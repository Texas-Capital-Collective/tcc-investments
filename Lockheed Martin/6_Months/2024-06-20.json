        "content": "While many exciting ideas compete for your dollars in the capital market, few sectors are as groundbreaking as space stocks to buy. At the core of this narrative is the push for exploring new boundaries and possibilities. It\u2019s really one of the few frontier arenas available.\n\nFrom an individual investor\u2019s perspective, space stocks to buy offers incredible diversification. That\u2019s especially the case if you\u2019re young and just staring out in your investing journey. The ideas mentioned here \u2013 especially the large-capitalization plays \u2013 will probably outlive all of us. In other words, these enterprises may provide cradle-to-grave type of expansion.\n\nMost importantly from a financial perspective, space-related enterprises provide a critical impetus for economic growth. As well, the synergies that materialize may spark new markets. According to McKinsey & Company, the global space economy could be worth $1.8 trillion by 2035. Last year, the sector reached a valuation of $630 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to launch your portfolio into orbit, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Below are enticing space stocks to buy.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the giants in the aerospace and defense industry, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) might not be the most exciting idea among space stocks to buy. However, it\u2019s one of the most predictable. Lockheed offers a range of sector-related solutions, particularly in satellite development and space exploration. Also, LMT stock may benefit cynically from rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nAt the moment, Lockheed has been flat this year, gaining just under 1%. Further, analysts aren\u2019t especially enthralled with the idea, rating LMT a consensus hold. Further, the average price target sits at $486.85, which implies only about 6% upside potential. However, the most optimistic target calls for a price per share of $551. Therefore, it\u2019s worth considering among space stocks to buy.\n\nFinancially, Lockheed posted net income of $6.78 billion or $27.32 per share in the trailing 12 months (TTM). Revenue in this cycle hit $69.64 billion. For fiscal 2024, covering experts anticipate earnings per share of $26.27, which represents a slight dip. However, sales may rise modestly to $69.76 billion, up 3.2%. Further, revenue may bump up again in fiscal 2025 to $72.36 billion.\n\nFinally, Lockheed offers a forward dividend yield of 2.74%. It\u2019s not exciting but it keeps the boat steady.\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother top-tier player within the aerospace and defense sector, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) presents a tempting but higher-risk idea. On the positive side, Northrop offers innovations regarding space systems. This includes satellite technology and space launch systems. It may also be relatively undervalued, trading at 17.36X forward earnings. For the first quarter of this year, this metric averaged 19.42X.\n\nHowever, one can also see the reason why NOC stock appears discounted. Since the start of the year, shares slipped more than 9%. Most of the volatility stemmed from the trailing month. Nevertheless, analysts appear eager to collect on the weakness. They rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $506.08 average price target, implying 19% upside potential.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Northrop posted net income of $2.16 billion or earnings of $14.35 per share. Revenue in the cycle hit $40.12 billion. Presently, its quarterly sales growth rate (year-over-year) stands at 8.9%. For fiscal 2024, experts believe that EPS may rise 6.4% to hit $24.78. On the top line, sales may expand by 4.6% to land at $41.11 billion.\n\nFurther, continued decent growth in fiscal 2025 \u2013 where EPS may reach $27.50 on sales of $43.11 billion \u2013 appears to bode well for NOC. It\u2019s one of the space stocks to buy.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nEasily the most controversial idea among the major space stocks to buy, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is risky. Sure, it commands a massive footprint in the broader aerospace arena. However, its civilian airliner business is taking a beating due to the reputational damage. A few years ago, people (rightfully) fretted about potentially dangerous anti-stall software. Now folks are worried about doors blowing off midflight.\n\nUnsurprisingly, BA stock is down more than 30%. It\u2019s ugly, no doubt about it. However, if we divorce the company from its ongoing troubles, Boeing does command incredible acumen in spacecraft and satellite systems. It\u2019s also relatively undervalued. Right now, shares trade at 1.39X trailing-year sales. During Q4 2023, this metric stood at 2.08X.\n\nNow, during the TTM period, Boeing suffered a net loss of $2.15 billion or $3.53 per share in the red. Revenue in the period reached $76.44 billion. However, the quarterly revenue growth rate slipped to 7.5% below parity.\n\nFiscal 2024 may see a massive erosion in EPS and only modest growth in sales. However, analysts project a 20% expansion in revenue to $94.51 billion in fiscal 2025. Could investors and customers forgive Boeing by then? It\u2019s possible.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet\u2019s get into the real spicy stuff for space stocks to buy, beginning with Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB). Based in Long Beach, California, Rocket Lab offers specialties regarding small satellite launch services and space systems. It\u2019s been generating significant momentum in the news cycle over the past several months. After plunging from its market debut, RKLB stock is attempting to break out of a long-term horizontal trend line.\n\nIn the trailing month, shares have gained almost 12% so we may getting there. Plus, RKLB stock is still trading at a relative discount. Currently, shares trade hands at 8.43X trailing-year revenue. That\u2019s pricey relative to the underlying aerospace and defense sector. However, the multiple run up to an average reading of 11.19X in Q4 2023.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Rocket Lab incurred a net loss of $181.21 million but generated revenue of $282.46 million. Its present quarterly revenue growth rate stands at 69%. For fiscal 2024, sales may rise 74.3% to hit $426.23 million. Further, the blue-sky target calls for $447.27 million.\n\nBy fiscal 2025, the top line could expand robustly to $588.89 million. And here, the high-side estimate calls for $690.1 million. It\u2019s risky but oh so tempting.\n\nSpire Global (SPIR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US data analytics company Spire Global Inc. (SPIR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt first glance, Spire Global (NYSE:SPIR) might not seem like the most promising idea among space stocks to buy. With a market cap of under $269 million, SPIR stock is tiny. It can go either way. So far, though, that direction has been pointed northward. A space-to-cloud data and analytics firm, Spire specializes in the tracking of global data sets powered by nanosatellites.\n\nWith so many launches scheduled to take place over the next few years, Spire could see explosive demand. That\u2019s probably the reason why analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy. Further, the average price target stands at $18, implying nearly 73% upside potential. Better yet, the high-side estimate calls for $20 per share, which projects over 92% growth.\n\nIn the TTM period, Spire incurred a net loss of $71.54 million. However, sales in the cycle reached $107.22 million. Currently, the company\u2019s quarterly sales growth rate comes in at 6.3%. For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate a favorable mitigation of red ink to $1.04 (previously $3.27). Also, revenue may land at $124.81 million, up 18.1%.\n\nEnticingly, sales could also fly in the following year to $154.85 million. If you don\u2019t mind volatility risk, SPIR is one of the space stocks to buy.\n\nPlanet Labs (PL) Beautiful space view of the Earth with cloud formation\n\nSource: KeyFame / Shutterstock.com\n\nEasily another high-risk, high-reward entity among space stocks to buy, Planet Labs (NYSE:PL) presents a specialty profile in the sector. The company focuses on Earth observation and satellite imagery. It further provides data analytics services. Notably, Planet Labs offers a range of applications, from scientific (understanding how our planet is evolving) to military and defense (basically spying on our enemies).\n\nAt the moment, PL stock is priced below two bucks. This translates to a market cap of under $544 million. It\u2019s a bit better than some other speculative space stocks to buy but not by much. However, with the lowly price point comes a key advantage: relative undervaluation. Right now, shares trade at 2.32X trailing-year revenue. Back about one year ago, this metric stood at 4.91X.\n\nIn the TTM period, Planet posted a net loss of $135.36 million or 47 cents per share. However, revenue in the cycle hit $228.43 million. Its current quarterly sales growth rate clocks in at 14.7%. For the current fiscal year, analysts believe there will be a slight mitigation of losses per share to 22 cents. More importantly, revenue may rise 15.4% to hit $254.78 million.\n\nBlackSky Technology (BKSY) (RKLB stock, space stocks) satellite over the Earth\n\nSource: Andrzej Puchta / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of my favorite space stocks to buy from a narrative standpoint, BlackSky Technology (NYSE:BKSY) is a literal penny stock. At the time of writing, shares trade hands at 93 cents a pop. Further, the market cap sits at $136.23 million. That\u2019s nothing and thus, it presents wild volatility risks. Still, I appreciate the underlying business: real-time geospatial intelligence and satellite imagery.\n\nWith BlackSky, the company brings myriad applications to the table, including those covering scientific and defense/security needs. Analysts really dig the idea, which is a good part of why I\u2019m bullish on it. Experts rate BKSY stock a unanimous strong buy. Moreover, the average price target clocks in at $3.17, implying nearly 240% upside potential. Further, the high-side estimate calls for a price per share of $4.\n\nDuring the TTM period, BlackSky incurred a loss of $52.35 million or 37 cents per share. However, revenue hit $100.33 million. And its current quarterly sales growth rate stands at 31.7%. For fiscal 2024, analysts are betting that the top line could fly to $108.94 million. If so, that would imply a growth rate of 15.3%.\n\nIn the following year, sales may rise to $138.54 million, up 27.2%. With that, BKSY is one of the space stocks to buy \u2013 if you can handle it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Long-term investing is possibly among the most boring things. After identifying a quality stock, it\u2019s a matter of holding with patience. On the other hand, investing in penny and meme stocks is exciting and attracts investors. There is a high degree of speculation and quick returns are tempting. Of course, it makes sense to allocate a small portion of the portfolio to penny and meme stocks. However, sustained value can only be created by exposure to undervalued blue-chip stocks.\n\nThe whole idea of value investing is to wait for the right opportunity. Even the best blue-chip stocks go through phases of price or time correction. That\u2019s the right time to grab these stocks and hold them for the next few years. A meaningful rally from a valuation gap generally translates into the stock outperforming the index.\n\nI, therefore, believe the undervalued blue-chip stocks discussed will likely outperform the index over the next three to five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal defense spending touched record highs of $2.44 trillion last year. It\u2019s likely that defense spending will continue to swell with rising geopolitical tensions globally. Defense stocks are, therefore, attractive for the long term, and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is worth considering. In the last 12 months, LMT stock has remained sideways. I expect a breakout rally after an extended period of consolidation for this 2.74% dividend yield stock.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Lockheed reported a robust order backlog of $159 billion. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. The defense company has guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion for the year. Value creation will continue through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nAt the same time, Lockheed is investing in next-generation defense technology. That will support upside in orders booked in the coming years. Some of the areas of research and development include hypersonic, next-generation interceptor, spectrum dominance and directed energy.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) on a gas station roof.\n\nSource: Denis Kuvaev / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) is another stock that has remained sideways in the last 12 months. At a forward P/E of 12, CVX stock looks attractive and offers a dividend yield of 4.25%.\n\nThe reason for the oil & gas stock remaining subdued is macroeconomic headwinds that have translated into weakness in oil prices. However, with expansionary monetary policies likely, I am bullish on oil trending higher. This is a near-term catalyst for CVX stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nI must add that Chevron is a blue chip worth holding in the core portfolio. The company has an investment-grade balance sheet and quality oil & gas assets. Further, the asset portfolio has an attractive break-even that translated into healthy cash flows.\n\nTo put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $6.8 billion for Q1 2024. Even with subdued oil prices, the annual OCF visibility is $28 billion. If oil trades at $100 per barrel, OCF will likely be more than $40 billion. The completion of its Hess (NYSE:HES) acquisition will also support cash flow upside.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock looks attractive and undervalued after a significant correction. My view is underscored by the point that PFE stock trades at a forward P/E of 11.8. Further, the biopharmaceutical stock offers a robust dividend yield of 6.13%.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the reason for the correction in PFE stock. First, growth has decelerated on the back of lower COVID-19 vaccine sales. Further, Pfizer has been impacted by drugs going off-patent.\n\nHowever, the biopharma major has a deep pipeline of drug candidates. Currently, 113 products are in the pipeline, with 37 in phase three. As new drugs are commercialized, there is visibility for growth.\n\nI must add that Pfizer has pursued acquisitions to boost its growth visibility. In December, the company completed the acquisition of Seagen for a consideration of $43 billion. The acquisition provides significant diversification in the oncology business. Therefore, there are multiple catalysts for growth, and PFE stock is likely to be a value creator from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
