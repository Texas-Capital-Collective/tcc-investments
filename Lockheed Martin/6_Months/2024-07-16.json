        "title": "3 Defense Stocks to Sell if Trump Wins in November",
        "content": "Following the June 27 presidential debate, the leader of Russia, Vladimir Putin, openly stated how seriously he takes former President Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to ending the war in Ukraine. With Trump vocal about the importance of ending America\u2019s wars, it\u2019s likely the defense industry will take a hit following the closure of Europe\u2019s biggest war in almost 80 years. As a result, it\u2019s highly likely that there will be several defense stocks to sell to maximize profits now from medium-term holdings.\n\nThis isn\u2019t because these companies are financially insolvent or no longer relevant during a Trump presidency, but rather because they are not as heavily funded by the government as they are under the current Biden administration. As such, investors may want to prepare for the eventuality that the bull run the defense industry stocks had in 2022 and 2023 will likely come to an end should Trump and his foreign policies prevail in November.\n\nRTX (RTX) A German army mobile Raytheon (RTX) MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) system on display during the Laage airbase open house.\n\nSource: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the defense stocks to sell with the most confidence from institutional investors, RTX (NYSE:RTX) has benefited greatly from the war in the Middle East. Today the company operates as a conglomerate of three major components, Raytheon Technologies, Collins Aerospace, and Pratt & Whitney. This results in a defense corporation whose revenue incomes are partially exposed to commercial market trends, but buffered by defense spending. Yet two major problems could arise from a Trump presidency.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirstly, Congress might want to increase funding for Ukraine, but Trump can veto the bills. Pair this with Republican lawmakers who have been more skeptical of foreign aid compared to Democrats, and RTX could lose big. That\u2019s because a spending cut in Ukraine could impact RTX\u2019s bottom line, as they recently secured a $282 million contract to supply air defense systems to the country.\n\nSecondly, a potential re-election of Donald Trump could pose a challenge. Trump has publicly advocated for ending the wars in Israel and Ukraine. This stance could threaten RTX\u2019s $1.7 billion program to provide Patriot missiles to both NATO and Israel. Thus, it\u2019s clear that a change in government policy could cut deep into RTX\u2019s booked revenues and impact future performance.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite being the biggest name in the modern aerospace industry, Lockheed Martin\u2019s (NYSE:LMT) outlook after the 2024 election could decrease significantly. Despite its recent contract wins in the satellite sector, its contracts to supply Javelin missiles and F-35s could be at risk of cuts to NATO funding and military acquisitions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Trump has widely advocated for spending cuts on the grossly overbudget F-35 program. In fact, seven years ago, the former president tweeted how billions of dollars need to be saved on out-of-control programs like the F-35. This slashed LMT\u2019s stock value by $4 billion in the days following his tweet.\n\nThis kind of rhetoric from Trump helps underscore his commitment to better managing taxpayer money, which in turn means less financial flexibility for contractors like LMT. Thus, should the former president return to office, he could enact sweeping measures to reign in government spending on the admittedly over-engineered fighter jet.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD) image of General Dynamics (GD) website, representing dividend stocks\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the primary producer of the M1 Abrams tank, which recently saw action in Ukraine, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) stands to lose a significant source of revenue potential in the event of peace in Eastern Europe. Considering that Trump openly intends to end this war, the potential resupply revenue that would come from expended tanks and other military materials produced by General Dynamics could come to a quick close.\n\nMoreover, while the company is very broadly diversified across several different defense sectors from aviation to maritime to ground systems, the Trump administration may curtail some spending on the programs that General Dynamics relies on beyond the M1 tank program.\n\nAs a result, investors may want to consider taking profits on General Dynamics\u2019 strong run over the last few years before it corrects in the face of a more conservative administration on the side of foreign policy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget AI...

        "title": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 23, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.44 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.3%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $17.06 billion, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.15% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lockheed?\n\nFor Lockheed, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.59%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Lockheed would post earnings of $5.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.33, delivering a surprise of +9.14%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nLockheed appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nTextron (TXT), another stock in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.49 for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +2.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.54 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Textron has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.29%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Lockheed Martin (LMT) Outperforming Other Aerospace Stocks This Year?",
        "content": "For those looking to find strong Aerospace stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers. Lockheed Martin (LMT) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.\n\nLockheed Martin is one of 46 individual stocks in the Aerospace sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #2 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.\n\nThe Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Lockheed Martin is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nWithin the past quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT's full-year earnings has moved 0.2% higher. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.\n\nBased on the latest available data, LMT has gained about 2.4% so far this year. In comparison, Aerospace companies have returned an average of -4.3%. This shows that Lockheed Martin is outperforming its peers so far this year.\n\nAnother stock in the Aerospace sector, TransDigm Group (TDG), has outperformed the sector so far this year. The stock's year-to-date return is 22.8%.\n\nIn TransDigm Group's case, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year increased 3.7% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nBreaking things down more, Lockheed Martin is a member of the Aerospace - Defense industry, which includes 22 individual companies and currently sits at #71 in the Zacks Industry Rank. On average, this group has lost an average of 9.8% so far this year, meaning that LMT is performing better in terms of year-to-date returns.\n\nTransDigm Group, however, belongs to the Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry. Currently, this 23-stock industry is ranked #30. The industry has moved +14.2% so far this year.\n\nGoing forward, investors interested in Aerospace stocks should continue to pay close attention to Lockheed Martin and TransDigm Group as they could maintain their solid performance.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT): One of the Best Dividend Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Stocks For Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nIn 2023, dividend stocks underperformed compared to the overall market, which was driven largely by tech stocks. As we move into the latter half of 2024, dividend stocks have shown a similar performance trend in the first half of the year. The Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, is down by 0.17% year-to-date, compared with a nearly 18% gain in the broader market. Dividend stocks are declining for two main reasons. First, high interest rates are drawing investors towards bonds instead. Second, the current surge in AI technology is capturing investors' focus on tech stocks. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has achieved its all-time high this year, surging by over 25% so far in 2024. That said, investors haven't completely lost faith in dividend stocks. When all is said and done, successful investing is about playing the long game. Dividend stocks have consistently delivered, accounting for 36% of the market's total return since 1927. Bank of America has also declared 2024 as \u2018the year of dividends\u2019.\n\nIn dividend investing, dividend growth stocks often take a lead over high-yield dividend stocks. Recent research indicates that companies providing consistent and sustainable dividends, without excessive payouts, have delivered the best long-term returns. Wellington Management conducted a study that categorized dividend-paying companies into five groups based on their payout levels. Since 1930, the research found that stocks with the highest dividend payouts generally performed similarly to those with high, but not the very highest, payouts, although they frequently traded places as the top performers over the decades.\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\n\nThe dividend growth strategy has become so prominent over the years that many companies in the US are steadily increasing their payouts. In 2023, dividend payments reached an all-time high and have consistently increased over the years. Analysts are very optimistic about dividend payments for 2024, and recent projections indicate that the companies are on course to meet this new target record. One of the key reasons for this growth is that many companies, especially large technology firms, have abundant cash reserves and are rapidly increasing their free cash flows. This strong financial position enables them to continue rewarding their investors with higher dividend payments. According to the latest report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, companies in the index paid $153.4 billion in dividends in the second quarter of 2024, up from $151.6 billion from the previous quarter and up from $143.2 billion in the same period last year. The report also mentioned that there were 539 reported dividend increases, compared to 460 in the prior-year period, marking a 17.2% year-over-year rise. The total amount of these dividend increases reached $20.4 billion for the quarter, up from $9.8 billion in Q2 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nDividend growth stocks are a hit with investors because they have rock-solid businesses, a steady cash flow, and strong balance sheets. These companies are top-notch for generating passive income. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources such as Forbes, Morningstar, Barron\u2019s, and Business Insider. From their latest articles, we gathered the stocks they collectively favored. Additionally, we assessed the sentiment of hedge funds for each stock using Insider Monkey's Q1 2024 database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in these companies. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). 5 Countries with the Most Special-Mission Aircraft in the World\n\nA military aircraft in flight, showing the strength of the company's combat & air mobility capability.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a Maryland-based aerospace and defense company that specializes in advanced technology systems, services, and products. The company has been catching investors' eye due to an increasing backlog, enhancements in manufacturing, and rising military expenditures. Its backlog is currently at $159 billion, representing over two years of sales. The backlog includes several National Security Space awards received during the first quarter of 2024, highlighting the extensive range of its portfolio. That said, with the federal government making up 75% of the company's annual sales, any changes in defense spending can significantly affect the company's performance. However, we think that the company is well-positioned for growth, thanks to its major programs and advancements in aviation and missile technology.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) reported growth in all segments. The Aeronautics business generated the highest revenue among all segments, exceeding $6.8 billion, up from $6.3 billion in the same period last year. Overall, the company's revenue came in at $17.2 billion, up 14% from the prior-year period. Its success is largely due to its hefty investments in research and development (R&D) and capital projects. Since the beginning of 2024, it has already unveiled a slew of new initiatives. In the most recent quarter, the company invested over $700 million in R&D, which shows that it has strong cash flow generation. It generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and $1.3 billion in free cash flow during the quarter.\n\nOn June 28, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) declared a quarterly dividend of $3.15 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. It is one of the best stocks for dividends on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for 21 consecutive years. In Q1 2024, it returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As of July 15, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.70%.\n\nAt the end of Q1 2024, 47 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), down from 58 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is nearly $1.4 billion. Among these hedge funds, Two Sigma Advisors was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.\n\nOverall LMT ranks 15th on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy. You can visit 15 Best Stocks For Dividends to see the other dividend stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of LMT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than LMT but that trades at less than 7 times its earnings and yields nearly 10%, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Leidos (LDOS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.29 a share, just 14 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 30, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $2.29 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.21 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Leidos has an Earnings ESP of 3.69%.\n\nLDOS is part of a big group of Aerospace stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Lockheed Martin (LMT) as well.\n\nLockheed Martin is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 23, 2024. LMT's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $6.60 a share seven days from its next earnings release.\n\nFor Lockheed Martin, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.44 is 2.59%.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, LDOS and LMT could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

It is expected to reach a $1.1 trillion evaluation by 2030 growing at an 8.9% CAGR. Government subsidization of space exploration initiatives, as well as private funding, are factors making this growth rate possible. Additionally, increased demand for satellites for telecommunication and meteorological purposes will further drive the space economy market in the future.\n\nWith space being one of the key markets in the future, make sure you don\u2019t miss out on these space stocks to buy now\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a leader within the multinational defense and aerospace industry.

However, a silver lining is that management is improving with regards to responsibilities. Cash from financing has increased 106.02% and free cash flow has grown 0.2% YOY, showing that management is improving profitability through their actions to some extent.\n\nSurprisingly, Lockheed Martin shows promise in its future. The company has landed a $4.6 million contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Its objective is to develop ML training methods, training AI agents to make informed decisions by considering simultaneous factors in beyond visual range (BVR) aerial missions.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Wins Contract to Support F-35 Jet Program",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT business segment, Aeronautics, recently secured a modification contract involving its F-35 fighter jet program. The contract is expected to be completed by January 2029.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $70.1 million, the award has been offered by the???Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. The latest modification requires Lockheed to provide a redesign for the synchronous dynamic random-access memory to support the F-35 aircraft diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages. The random-access memory will be used in Technical Refresh\n\nThree integrated core processors and panoramic cockpit displays of F-35 jets.\u00a0\r\nWork related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nRapidly increasing security threats across different regions of the world, like the Russian invasion of Ukraine as well as the long-going unrest in varied parts of the Middle East, have prompted nations to modernize their defense arsenal significantly in recent times. As aerial security constitutes a critical part of a nation\u2019s defense structure, an increased investment trend in technologically advanced fighter jets, which come with enhanced stealth capabilities, like F-35 jets, is being witnessed lately.\n\nIt is imperative to mention in this context that Lockheed\u2019s F-35 program is the most lethal fighter jet, which delivers 5th generation for mission readiness. Equipped with advanced sensors and communications suites, it can serve across every domain, including air, land, sea, space and cyber.\n\nSuch remarkable features must have been boosting the demand for this jet, which, can be further gauged from the fact that Lockheed has delivered 992 F-35 airplanes as of Mar 31, 2024, since its inception. The latest contract win bears yet another testament to the solid demand that the F-35 jets enjoy in the combat jet market.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAs nations across the globe seek to strengthen their aerial defense capabilities, factors like aging fighter jet fleets, innovation of modern fighter aircraft that offer improved speed, agility, and payload capacity than their predecessors, and frequent cross-border conflicts have been boosting the demand for new-age fighter jets. This might have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to project that the global military aviation market will witness a CAGR of 5.2% during 2024-2030.\n\nSuch projections indicate immense growth opportunities for prominent combat jet manufacturers like Lockheed. The company has been designing and manufacturing some of the finest military aircraft for more than a century now. LMT\u2019s fighter jet portfolio includes C-130 Super Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-21, F-22 Raptor and a few more combat aircraft, in addition to F-35 jets.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nLMT apart, a few defense players that are expected to gain from the expanding military aviation market are mentioned below:\n\nAirbus EADSY: Its military aircraft consists of an A400M airlifter, a C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived. In addition to manufacturing these combat jets, Airbus has been providing its customers with an extended portfolio of services, ranging from the training of Flight and Ground Crews up to live firing exercises anywhere around the world, for more than 40 years.\n\nEADSY boasts a long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth rate of 13.9%.

        "title": "5 High ROE Stocks to Buy as Low Inflation Fuels Rate Cut Hopes",
        "content": "The broader U.S. equity markets witnessed a steady uptrend over the past few trading days, buoyed by optimism related to rate cuts driven by easing inflationary pressures. The June consumer price index declined for the first time in more than four years by 0.1% from May, putting the 12-month rate at 3% \u2013 the lowest level in more than three years.\r\n\r\nThese ignited hopes of a possible rate cut as early as September. The optimism was further propelled by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s latest views that keeping interest rates elevated for too long could risk economic growth. The subtle hint of a less-restrictive stance probably aided the uptrend. A healthy quarterly earnings performance from hitherto reported companies added to the stock market euphoria.\r\n\r\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of \u201cbacking and filling\u201d in the market, they can benefit from \u201ccash cow\u201d stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. United Therapeutics Corporation UTHR, ABB Ltd ABBNY, Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT, MPLX LP MPLX and Banco de Chile BCH are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nROE: A Key Metric\n\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders\u2019 Equity\r\n\r\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry \u2014 the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management\u2019s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.\r\n\r\nPrice/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.\r\n\r\nReturn on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.\r\n\r\n5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength. \r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nHere are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nUnited Therapeutics: Silver Spring, MD-based United Therapeutics markets four medicines in the United States to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension: Remodulin, an injectable formulation of treprostinil, Orenitram, an oral version of treprostinil, Tyvaso, an inhaled version of treprostinil, and Adcirca (tadalafil; also sold by Eli Lilly as Cialis for erectile dysfunction) tablets. The company is also focused on research and development efforts to address the shortage of transplantable organs and tissues through regenerative medicine and organ manufacturing.\r\n\r\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.2% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.4%, on average. It has a VGM Score of A. United Therapeutics carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \r\n\r\nABB: Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, ABB offers electrification, motion and automation products and solutions for diverse customers in utilities, transport and infrastructure sectors across the globe. The company\u2019s solutions leverage engineering know-how and software to optimize operations and accelerate industrial transformation.\r\n\r\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 8.9%. ABB carries a Zacks Rank #2. \r\n\r\nLockheed Martin: Based in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world. Its main areas of focus are defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cyber security. Lockheed Martin currently operates through four businesses \u2014 Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Missions Systems and Space Systems. \r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 4.1% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.1%, on average. It has a VGM Score of A.\u00a0 Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #2.\r\n\r\nMPLX: Findlay, OH-based MPLX LP is a master limited partnership engaged in providing a wide range of midstream energy services, including fuel distribution solutions. The large-cap partnership was created in 2012 to own, operate and develop midstream energy infrastructures and logistics assets, mostly for its parent company, Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Notably, Marathon Petroleum holds around 64% of MPLX's outstanding common units.\r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 5% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.6%, on average.

        "content": "Defense Contractors Stocks Q1 Results: Benchmarking Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season comes to a close, it\u2019s time to take stock of this quarter's best and worst performers in the defense contractors industry, including Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and its peers.\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 13 defense contractors stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.5%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.7% above consensus. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, and defense contractors stocks have held roughly steady amidst all this, with share prices up 1.7% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)\n\nHeadquartered in Maryland, Famous for the F-35 aircraft, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) specializes in defense, space, homeland security, and information technology products.\n\nLockheed Martin reported revenues of $17.2 billion, up 13.7% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 7.5%. Overall, it was a stunning quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts' organic revenue estimates and a decent beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\n\"Our strong start to 2024 demonstrates our continued success designing, developing and delivering 21st Century Security solutions in support of integrated deterrence for customers around the world.
