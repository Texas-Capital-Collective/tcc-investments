        "content": "(Reuters) - A joint venture between Lockheed Martin and RTX's Raytheon was awarded a $1.3 billion follow-on contract by the U.S. army for its Javelin missiles, which has played a major role in Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion, Lockheed said on Thursday.\n\nThis latest agreement is part of a larger contract awarded last year, which could reach up to $7.2 billion for an \"indefinite quantity\" of missiles between 2023 and 2026.\n\nSince then, the joint venture has been ramping up Javelin production, with plans to reach an annual manufacturing capacity of around 4,000 missiles by late 2026.\n\nThe new contract includes the production of more than 4,000 Javelins specifically to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine, the Maryland-based defense contractor said.\n\nDemand for U.S. weaponry, particularly shoulder-mounted Javelin systems, remains high in Europe due to the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n(Reporting by Pratyush Thakur in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)",

        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Leidos (LDOS). Shares have added about 8.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Leidos due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nLeidos Holdings Beats on Q2 Earnings, Ups '24 EPS View\n\nLeidos Holdings\u2019 second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.63 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.26 by 16.4%.

Of this amount, $8.02 billion was funded.\n\nOperational Statistics\n\nThe cost of revenues increased 4.8% year over year to $3,427 million.

The increase can be attributed to increased volumes from the Sentinel contract, Defense Enclave Services (\u201cDES\u201d) program and several contracted research as well as development efforts.\n\nThis segment\u2019s adjusted operating income increased to $188 million from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level of $183 million. The segment\u2019s adjusted operating margin was 10.4%, up 20 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter\u2019s 10.2%.\n\nHealth & Civil: The segment recorded revenues of $1.26 billion, up 22.1% year over year.

The upside was driven by increased deliveries of security products and higher volumes within the commercial energy and Australian IT businesses.\n\nThis segment recorded an adjusted operating income of $42 million compared with $23 million in the year-ago period. The adjusted operating margin was 8.3%, up 360 bps year over year.\n\nDefense Systems: Revenues in this segment amounted to $495 million, up 6.2% year over year.

The adjusted operating margin was 0.7%, down 750 bps year over year.\n\nFinancials\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of Jun 28, 2024, totaled $823 million compared with $777 million as of Dec 29, 2023.\n\nThe long-term debt, net of the current portion, amounted to $4.11 billion as of Jun 28, 2024, compared with $4.66 billion as of Dec 29, 2023.\n\nNet cash flow from operating activities totaled $437 million at the end of the second quarter of 2024 compared with $66 million recorded a year ago.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nLeidos Holdings has partially raised its 2024 guidance. The company now expects to generate adjusted earnings in the range of $8.60-$9.00 per share, up from the prior guidance of $8.40-$8.80. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $8.75 per share, lower than the mid-point of the company\u2019s projected range.\n\nLDOS currently expects 2024 revenues to be in the band of $16.10-$16.40 billion, narrower than the earlier guidance of $16.0-$16.4 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.12 billion, lower than the mid-point of the company\u2019s new guided range.\n\nThe company continues to expect cash flow from operating activities of approximately $1.3 billion in 2024.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -6.36% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, Leidos has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Leidos has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nLeidos is part of the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry. Over the past month, Lockheed Martin (LMT), a stock from the same industry, has gained 4.1%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended June 2024 more than a month ago.\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $18.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.6%.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +4.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has gained 2.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.40 per share, indicating a change of -5.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -4.8%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.86 indicates a change of +8.9% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Lockheed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.45 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $71.14 billion and $73.99 billion estimates indicate +5.3% and +4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $18.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.6%. EPS of $7.11 for the same period compares with $6.73 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.12 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.88%. The EPS surprise was +10.23%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.

Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
