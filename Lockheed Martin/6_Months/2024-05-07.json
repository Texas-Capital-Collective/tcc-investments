        "title": "What Boeing's delayed rocket launch means for the company, according to Intuitive Machines CEO",
        "content": "Boeing (BA) delayed the launch of its Starliner space capsule Monday after identifying a faulty oxygen relief valve just hours before liftoff.\n\nEarly Tuesday, NASA said the launch, which was expected to carry two astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), would be rescheduled to \u201cno earlier than Friday, May 10.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe delay allows teams to complete data analysis on a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank of the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage and determine whether it is necessary to replace the valve,\u201d NASA said in a statement.\n\nThe launch of the CST-100 Starliner on board the United Launch Alliance (ULA) rocket, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin (LMT) joint venture, was supposed to mark Boeing\u2019s first crewed flight and a big step forward for a firm plagued by design flaws and a botched flight attempt.\n\nBut mission teams scrubbed the launch two hours before liftoff. NASA astronauts Barry \u201cButch\u201d Wilmore and Sunita Williams were set to spend a week on the International Space Station while the Starliner remained docked.\n\n\u201cIt has been a real challenge for them to get their spacecraft ready to go and safe for our astronauts,\u201d said Intuitive Machines (LUNR) founder and CEO Steve Altemus, speaking at the Milken Institute\u2019s Global Conference. \u201cWhile they've worked through some very difficult technical challenges, what's the future of that program? I'm not quite sure how it will persist over time and what kind of investment it'll take.\u201d NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore exit the Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a mission dress rehearsal on Friday, April 26, 2024. (Frank Micheaux/NASA via AP) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAerospace has 'fundamentally changed'\n\nThe delay marked the latest setback for a company already grappling with quality control and safety issues in its aviation business, including a slew of problems linked to its 737 Max models.\n\nBoeing began developing Starliner in 2014 after winning a $6.8 billion NASA contract along with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. Since then, SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon capsule has flown nine crewed flights for NASA and four flights with private astronauts, while Boeing has failed to keep up.\n\nBoeing's first attempt to reach the ISS was unsuccessful after its onboard clock was set incorrectly, causing the computer to fire the capsule\u2019s engines prematurely. The program has incurred more than $1.5 billion in cost overruns.\n\nAltemus, whose company has partnered with Boeing and Northrop Grumman (NOC) to develop a lunar terrain vehicle for NASA, said Boeing's challenges highlight a fundamental shift within the new space economy.\n\n\u201cIt speaks to a broader issue in the industry about what's the role of the traditional prime contractor or the strategic aerospace company,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the environment of NASA and the way they're doing nontraditional procurements to buy goods and services for the Artemis program has fundamentally changed the landscape and disrupted strategic aerospace.\u201d\n\nStory continues Photographers capture the Boeing Starliner capsule atop an Atlas V rocket as it is rolled out to the launch pad on May 4, 2024, in Cape Canaveral, Fla. (AP Photo/Terry Renna) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe space economy is in the midst of a rapid evolution, driven by SpaceX. Borrowing from a playbook established by founder Elon Musk, firms are moving quicker, building bigger, and slashing costs in the process, bringing a tech startup-like mentality to space exploration.\n\nMuch of that growth has been limited to rockets and satellites, but NASA has added fuel by leaning on private companies to take on the risk of further space exploration to the moon and beyond.\n\nAltemus said that the push to move faster and be more flexible has put smaller companies like Intuitive in the driver\u2019s seat. NASA has already awarded the company more than $100 million to develop an end-to-end lunar delivery service in addition to developing the lunar terrain vehicle.\n\nIn February, Intuitive became the first commercial company to reach the surface of the moon, although its lunar vehicle Odysseus tipped on its side upon landing, altering the mission.\n\n\"The government is asking us as commercial companies to share the risk,\" Altemus said. \"Sometimes with the larger strategic aerospace companies, their boards and their shareholders are not comfortable with that risk posture, where a smaller, more nimble, agile company can maybe work around those financial risks and be successful.\"\n\n\"I think the companies that can figure this out, the ones who can manage with these non-traditional procurements, will be the tier one aerospace companies of the future,\" he added.\n\nCatch more of Yahoo Finance's coverage at the 2024 Milken Institute Global Conference.\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Defense Stocks to Sell in May Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Although geopolitical tensions are high and defense spending is generally on the rise globally, not all defense stocks companies will benefit. Some defense contractors may face challenges. Those include supply chain disruptions, labor shortages or reputational risks that could impact performance and prices.\n\nMoreover, the defense industry is heavily dependent on government contracts and budget allocations. And those can be highly unpredictable and subject to political shifts. Companies that rely heavily on a few key contracts or have a narrow product portfolio may be more vulnerable to changes in government priorities or spending cuts.\n\nMore specifically, some defense stocks have a mix of weakening fundamentals and overvalued natures. Let\u2019s explore some of those that investors should sell this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRTX Corporation (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is known for its aerospace and defense products. Quite recently, it faced a significant setback with a defect discovered in 1,200 of its jet engines. This issue requires grounding and inspection of the engines, which could impact the company\u2019s financial performance and reputation.\n\nImportantly, RTX did very well in its Q1 results. Also, the Raytheon defense division showed strong profit margin growth. However, the Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney divisions experienced margin declines. This could be a concern, as these two divisions account for a significant portion of RTX\u2019s revenue.\n\nSome analysts\u2019 commentary leans into RTX being currently overvalued. It trades at high multiples compared to both its historical averages as well as the median for its peer universe. So although a solid stock, a pullback may be needed, and it could be primed for a retracement.\n\nThe Boeing Company (BA) image of a Boeing (BA) 737 max aircraft. stocks to buy and sell related to Boeing\n\nSource: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has also experienced challenges. The company\u2019s stock performance has been underwhelming compared to market expectations. Furthermore, BA has faced production issues and other operational difficulties.\n\nBad news has been abound for the stock, which is perhaps one of the most impactful media disasters of the last decade for a company. Also, last month, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) indicated that there could be more bad news forthcoming.\n\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Calhoun mentioned that 737 production will be \u201cslow and lumpy\u201d in Q2 as the company works through challenges over the next 60 days. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Brian West also indicated that Boeing is slowing near-term production of the 787 Dreamliner. The company is planning to return to five per month later in the year. So, these production issues could impact the company\u2019s performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, Northcoast Research cut its rating for BA stock to sell from neutral. It cites channel checks that point to a lower build rate for the 787 Dreamliner than Boeing\u2019s claim of five per month. This discrepancy could indicate an underlying problem not yet shared with investors.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile traditionally a strong performer, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has recently been subject to concerns over its valuation and the sustainability of its growth.\n\nLMT stock has underperformed the S&P 500 in 2021 and 2023, despite outperforming in 2022. This inconsistent performance, especially during a period when many other stocks have provided better returns with less risk, may make LMT less attractive to some investors.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, despite strong revenue growth, Lockheed Martin\u2019s consolidated operating margin declined by 170 basis points year-over-year (YOY) to 11.8% in Q1. Lower operating margins led to a decrease in earnings per share compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nLike RTX, I think that LMT is a great stock but its valuation is too rich due to its own success. Its high valuation makes it more vulnerable to market and systemic risks than others. Therefore, it should be worth waiting on the sidelines before considering adding LMT to one\u2019s portfolio. And similar to RTX, it also trades at high valuation multiples to its historical performance. This prompts caution.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
