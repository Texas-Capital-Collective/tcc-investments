The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. It has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins.\r\n\r\nThis led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently, PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues, higher SG&A costs, higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks, which acts as a headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of ServiceNow have gained +0.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry\u2019s gain of +5.1%.

The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. The company\u2019s products also witness a strong international demand.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact Lockheed\u2019s operating results. China\u2019s sanctions imposed on Lockheed might also affect its business.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Steel Partners have underperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the year-to-date period (-8.5% vs. +0.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $747.01 million has a diversified portfolio across various sectors and the inclusion of Steel Connect, SPLP mitigates risks and boosts growth.

SPLP also reduced interest expenses by 76.7% in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nYet, the adjusted EBITDA margin declined from 14.2% to 12.3% in the first quarter of 2024 due to an underperformance in the Energy and Diversified Industrial segments. Energy revenues fell 33.7% and Diversified Industrial sales decreased 3.9%, impacting profitability. Also, fluctuations due to geopolitical tensions impact operational costs and investor confidence.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Steel Partners here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

        "title": "RTX Secures a $678M Contract to Aid AN/SPY-6(V) Family of Radars",
        "content": "RTX Corp.\u2019s RTX business unit, Missiles and Defense, recently clinched a modification deal involving the AN/SPY-6(V) family of radars. The award has been provided by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $677.7 million, the contract is estimated to be completed by September 2028. The latest modification should enable RTX to exercise options for hardware production of the AN/SPY-6(V) family of radars.\n\nA major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Andover, MA.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring RTX?\n\nWith the rapid escalation of geopolitical tensions globally in recent times, nations across the board have been significantly boosting their defense arsenal. Since radars constitute a vital part of this arsenal, escalation in defense spending has been benefiting radar manufacturing companies like RTX, in the form of solid order flows for radar production and associated upgrades. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that RTX\u2019s SPY-6 is the U.S. Navy family of radars that performs air and missile defense on seven classes of ships.\n\nThese radars can defend against ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles, hostile aircraft and surface ships simultaneously. The solid demand for this product can be gauged from the fact that SPY-6 radar arrays are being integrated into the U.S. Navy\u2019s newest ships, including DDG 51 Flight III destroyers, frigates, aircraft carriers and amphibious warships.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nThe demand for military radar systems has expanded manifold in recent times, driven by factors like the rise in defense spending of emerging economies, increase in regional tensions and inter-country conflicts that have boosted threats from missiles and aircraft. This has set the stage for ample growth opportunities for the military radar market.\n\nThe Markets and Markets firm projects the global military radar market to witness a CAGR of 4.7% during 2023-2027. Such growth projections bode well for prominent radar manufacturers like RTX.\n\nNotably, RTX\u2019s product portfolio consists of varied radars like integrated air and missile defense radars, ballistic missile radars, surveillance radars as well as air dominance radars. Radars like AN-TPY-2, APG-79 and APG-82 are some of the company\u2019s combat-proven products that enjoy solid demand in the global military radar market, apart from AN/SPY-6.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nRTX apart, other defense contractors that are major radar manufacturers and thus expected to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the global military radar market are discussed below:\n\nStory continues\n\nLockheed Martin LMT: Its radars are the choice of more than 45 nations on six continents. The company\u2019s product portfolio includes various radar systems like AN/APY-9 radar, airborne ground surveillance radar systems, AN/TPQ-53 radar systems, SPY-7, the long-range discrimination radar, FPS-117 and a few more.\n\nLockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.10%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings implies an improvement of 3.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nL3Harris Technologies LHX: The company manufactures combat-proven radars like SPS-48, land-based surveillance radar, AN/APY-11 Multimode radar, Tactical Air Surveillance radar, AN/SPS-48G Long range 3D surveillance radar and many more.\u00a0 Notably, its Vigilant family of software-defined, radar electronic support measures solutions is essential for survival and dominance in the electromagnetic threat environment of the modern battlefield.\n\nL3Harris boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings implies an improvement of 9.4% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: As a pioneer in Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars, NOC has been at the forefront of AESA innovations for more than 60 years. Its broad portfolio of products also includes radars like AN/APG-83 scalable agile beam radar, AN/ASQ-236 Dragon\u2019s eye radar pod as well as AN/APG-81 and AN/APG-71 for F-35 and F-22 jets, respectively.\n\nNorthrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nThe company\u2019s shares have risen 10.7% in the past year against the industry\u2019s decline of 9.5%.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Secures a Contract to Support F-35 Jet Program",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT Aeronautics business segment recently secured a contract to procure aircraft armament equipment for its F-35 fighter jets. The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $97 million, the contract is projected to be completed by February 2028. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will procure aircraft armament equipment like internal adapters and weapon umbilical cables required to employ long-range strike weapons. This procurement will allow for internal carriage and employment of the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile \u2013 Extended Range weapon for LMT\u2019s F-35 Lightning II aircraft.\n\nThe contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Foreign Military Sales customers, and non-U.S. Department of Defense program participants. Work related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX.\n\nSignificance of F-35 Jets\n\nLockheed\u2019s F-35 is the most lethal, survivable and connected fighter jet in the world. It can securely connect high-tech platforms to share information across every domain, air, land, sea, space and cyber. The aircraft comes in three main variants, which are F-35A (conventional takeoff and landing), F-35B (short take-off and vertical landing) and F-35C (carrier-based).\n\nSuch remarkable features of this fighter jet are likely to have been bolstering the demand for the F-35 aircraft. F-35\u2019s solid demand can be further gauged from the fact that Lockheed has delivered 992 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 373 jets in the backlog as of Mar 31, 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, LMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets in 2024 and 156 in 2025 and beyond. This, along with the latest contract win, can be expected to significantly boost Lockheed\u2019s revenue growth in the coming quarters, considering the fact that F-35 jet program generated approximately 25% of the company\u2019s total consolidated net sales in first-quarter 2024.\n\nLMT\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nAmid the geopolitical tensions prevalent across the globe, nations are rapidly augmenting defense purchases to strengthen their warfare capabilities. This has led to an increased demand for fighter jets, which form an integral part of a country\u2019s defense products. Per a report by the Mordor Intelligence firm, the global military aviation market is estimated to witness a CAGR of 5.23% during 2024-2030.\n\nSuch projections indicate immense growth opportunities for prominent combat jet manufacturers like Lockheed. Its Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgradation of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. The company\u2019s fighter jet portfolio includes C-130 Super Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon jet and F-16 Fighting Falcon, in addition to F-35 jets.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer Opportunities\n\nOther defense players that are expected to gain from the expanding global military aviation market are discussed below:\n\nAirbus EADSY: Its military aircraft consists of the A400M, C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and the Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived. The company delivered a total of 1,783 military aircraft as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\nEADSY boasts a long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth rate of 21.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus\u2019 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 8.2% from the top line reported in 2023.\n\nThe Boeing Company BA: Its product portfolio includes a range of combat-proven aircraft like the F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8, C-17 Globemaster III, EA-18G and a few more. In 2023, Boeing delivered 22 F/A-18s, nine F-15s, three T-7A Red Hawks and 11 P-8 models.\n\nBA has a long-term earnings growth rate of 27.5%. The consensus estimate for Boeing\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 2.1% from the top line reported in 2023.\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It has built some of the world\u2019s most advanced aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. The significant awards won by NOC in 2023 included $1.7 billion for E-2 and $1.5 billion for Triton jets.\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop Grumman\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the top line reported in 2023.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the past year, shares of LMT have risen 4.5% against the industry\u2019s 9.5% decline.

The company reported Q1 2024 revenue of $93 million, although it currently has an EPS of -$0.37\u200b.\n\nStory continues\n\nRocket Lab\u2019s recent $515 million U.S. government contract for designing and operating space vehicles is something to note. The contract involves designing, manufacturing, delivering, and operating 18 space vehicles, with a base amount of $489 million and potential incentives of $26 million. The company has successfully launched 42 Electron rockets and continues to demonstrate technological advancements\u200b.\r\n\r\nWith an analyst target price of $7.57 and a 52-week high of $8.05, Rocket Lab offers upside for growth-oriented investors\u200b.\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) spce stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nVirgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), headquartered in Las Cruces, New Mexico, is an aerospace company focused on developing manned spaceflight for private individuals and researchers.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the company reported a loss of 25 cents per share and revenue came in at 2 million. With a market capitalization of $347.9 million and shares outstanding totaling 411.4 million, SPCE faces financial challenges, reflected in its negative EPS of -$1.17.\n\nDespite the company\u2019s efforts, including plans to produce larger Delta-class ships and price tickets at $450,000 per seat, profitability remains elusive. The decision to raise $400 million through a common stock sale caused an 18% share price drop, underlining investor concerns.\n\nWith a price to sales ratio of 63.54 and a book value of $1.03, Virgin Galactic\u2019s high volatility and uncertain financial trajectory pose substantial risks, necessitating careful consideration for potential investors.\n\nStill, despite these concerns, SPCE could be one of the best pure-play space stocks for investors to consider adding to their portfolios thanks to its tiny valuation at just 85 cents per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
