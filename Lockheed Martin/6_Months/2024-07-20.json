The company had Q1 2024 net sales of $17.2 billion, a 14% increase annually. Adjusting for the extra calendar week, the normalized sales growth was 5%. This growth was primarily driven by higher volumes across its business segments, particularly in aeronautics, missiles and fire control (MFC). The segment\u2019s operating profit was $1.7 billion, with margins of 10.1%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, Lockheed Martin maintains a high backlog of\u00a0$159 billion, reflecting top-line solid visibility. The backlog includes lead programs (F-35 and C-130) and missile defense systems. The approved\u00a02024 defense budget and early indications for fiscal 2025 marks high government support for Lockheed Martin\u2019s programs. These include\u00a0robust\u00a0funding for munitions, hypersonics and classified activities, including continued investment in major platforms like the F-35 and CH-53K. The budget additions for fiscal 2025 further boost Lockheed Martin\u2019s growth prospects. Hence, these additions ensure sustained funding for critical defense programs.\n\nLockheed is on the election stocks to buy list due to its revenue growth, substantial backlog and strong government support.\n\nStory continues\n\nLowe\u2019s Companies (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe retail home improvement giant Lowe\u2019s Companies (NYSE:LOW) delivered first-quarter sales of $21.4 billion.\u00a0This\u00a0reflects a 4.1% annual decline in comparable sales. Despite this, Lowe\u2019s strategic agility allowed it to capitalize on\u00a0crucial\u00a0categories like outdoor power equipment, which\u00a0was\u00a0enhanced\u00a0by partnerships such as the launch of Toro products.\n\nThis\u00a0expanded Lowe\u2019s market appeal and customer base. Lowe\u2019s Total Home strategy, emphasizing professional (Pro) and online sales growth, yielded positive outcomes in Q1. Pro sales have\u00a0been boosted\u00a0by strategic investments in service improvements and expanded brand portfolios like Klein Tools. These initiatives targeted small- to medium-sized pros, a lucrative segment in the\u00a0$500 billion pro-market.\n\nFurther, online sales at\u00a0Lowe\u2019s grew approximately 1% in Q1, showcasing ongoing improvements in conversion rates despite challenges in DIY\u00a0bigger\u00a0ticket categories. The company expanded its same-day delivery options through partnerships with DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) and Shipped, complementing existing services like Instacart and OneRail. Moreover, the national rollout of MyLowe\u2019s Rewards program further enhanced customer loyalty and personalized shopping experiences.\n\nLowe\u2019s is included in the election stocks to buy list for its strategic adaptations in a competitive retail environment.\n\nLennar (LEN) len stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nLennar (NYSE:LEN) is the largest homebuilder in the U.S. The company can maintain consistent production and sales numbers, which is vital for scalability and efficiency in the homebuilding industry. In Q2 2024, Lennar started approximately 21,400 homes, sold about 21,300 homes, and delivered around 19,700 homes. This near alignment between starts, sales and deliveries (with slight variations) indicates sharp operational planning and execution.\n\nMoreover, margin management is another strength highlighted by Lennar. The company attained a margin of\u00a022.6% in Q2, which is sequentially up from 21.8% in the previous quarter. Lennar\u00a0targets around 23% margin for Q3 2024. Lennar has a sharp focus on cash flow generation and strategic capital allocation. It allocated over $600 million for share repurchases and paid off\u00a0$550 million of senior debt.\u00a0This\u00a0is boosting the company\u2019s financial flexibility and market value potency. Thus, with $3.6 billion in cash and a low % debt-to-capital ratio of\u00a07.7%,\u00a0Lennar progressively invests in growth initiatives while managing financial risk prudently.\n\nFinally, Lennar is on the election stocks to buy list due to its constant production and sales performance, sharp margin management and cash flow generation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Exclusive-US-Japan Patriot missile production plan hits Boeing component roadblock",
        "content": "By Nobuhiro Kubo and Tim Kelly\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - A U.S. plan to use Japanese factories to boost production of Patriot air defence missiles - used by Ukraine to defend against Russian attacks - is being delayed by a shortage of a critical component manufactured by Boeing, four sources said.\n\nJapan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) already makes about 30 PAC-3 missiles each year under licence from defence contractor Lockheed Martin and can increase that number to about 60, two Japanese government officials and two industry sources told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. hopes to increase production from about 500 a year to more than 750 per year globally as soon as possible, a person familiar with the program said. But no expansion at all will be possible in Japan without additional supplies of the missiles' seekers, which guide them in the final stages of flight, the officials and industry sources said.\n\n\"It could take several years before MHI is able to raise output\" because of the shortage, said one of the industry sources, who like the others declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nThe production snag in Japan shows the challenges Washington faces in plugging industrial help from its global allies into its complex supply chains.\n\nBoeing last year began expanding its seeker factory in the United States to increase production by 30%, although the additional lines won't operate until 2027. The company did not say last year how many were produced, but noted it had just delivered its 5,000th.\n\nA Boeing representative referred questions to Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for the interceptor.\n\nLockheed Martin has said it is increasing its U.S. output of Patriot interceptors from 500 to 650 by 2027. Each costs about $4 million.\n\nEven if enough seekers are available, expanding annual PAC-3 production in Japan beyond 60 would require MHI to build more capacity.\n\nIn its 2022 plan to double military spending, Japan's government said it would offer financial help to defence companies that wanted to expand production. Those subsidies, however, only apply to equipment destined for the country's Self Defense Forces and not exports.\n\nThat means that MHI or the United States would have to stump up the money to pay for a new PAC-3 factory, which could cost tens of millions of dollars or more, one of the Japanese government sources said.\n\n\"The Indo-Pacific is a large area of focus for the U.S. and our allies and strategically postured capabilities in the region are critical to support deterrence and maintain readiness,\" Lockheed Martin said in an email, referring questions about PAC-3 production in Japan to the Japanese and U.S. governments, and MHI.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan's Ministry of Defense declined to comment. MHI declined to comment.\n\nA U.S. defence official said a $4.5 billion contract signed in June with the U.S. Army - the Patriot system's primary customer - marked the beginning of a ramp-up in production of both missiles and seekers.\n\nForeign and defence ministers from Japan and the United States are set to meet in Tokyo this month for talks that are expected to include deepening industrial cooperation on defence. The Patriot project is seen as a key part of that effort.\n\nEven with help from allies, supply chain bottlenecks complicate U.S. efforts to supply Ukraine's demand for munitions, including air defence systems that can thwart Russian attacks.\n\nIn the deadliest wave of air strikes in months, a Russian missile in July struck a children's hospital, killing at least 41 civilians.\n\nIn December 2023, Japan eased military export rules to allow it to help replenish U.S. Patriot missile stocks, which had been tapped to help Ukraine.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, who called that a \"historic decision\", has been a leading proponent of deeper military industrial ties with Japan that could ease the strain on U.S. defence contractors.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida agreed in April to deepen defence industry cooperation.\n\nIn an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal two months after that meeting, Emanuel described a shrunken U.S. military industrial complex as a \"weak link\" that had been exposed by the Ukraine war and the Middle East conflict.\n\n(Reporting by Nobuhiro Kubo, Tim Kelly; additional reporting by Mike Stone, Allison Lampert, Idrees Ali and Kaori Kaneko; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Sam Holmes)",
