        "title": "Lockheed Martin, Tata Advanced Systems Join Forces for C-130J Jet",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently inked an agreement with Tata Advanced Systems Ltd to establish a framework for enhancing business opportunities for LMT\u2019s C-130J Super Hercules tactical airlifter. This should strengthen the long-standing partnership between Lockheed and Tata Advanced Systems, the Tata Lockheed Martin Aerostructures Ltd. (\u201cTLMAL\u201d) joint venture, established in 2010.\r\n\r\nWith India rising as one of the forerunners in the combat aviation market within Asia-Pacific, the latest agreement should bode well for LMT\u2019s expansion in this space.\n\nA Brief Note on LMT\u2019s Latest Collaboration\n\nThe latest agreement establishes a framework for collaboration, including the establishment of a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul facility in India to serve the Indian Air Force's (\u201cIAF\u201d) existing fleet of 12 C-130Js as well as other worldwide Super Hercules fleets. As part of this agreement, Lockheed will expand C-130J manufacturing and assembly in India to produce aircraft for the IAF's Medium Transport Aircraft program, provided the U.S. and Indian governments approve.\r\n\r\nThe IAF is actively looking to buy up to 80 medium transport aircraft, having published a request for information in 2023. The latest expansion in partnership between Lockheed and Tata Advanced Systems is expected to cater to this demand for transport jets.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for LMT?\n\nRising geopolitical tensions, technical developments, higher defense expenditures from economic growth, comprehensive defense modernization projects and strategic alliances with Western defense contractors are all contributing to the combat aircraft market's expansion in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n\r\nThis must have prompted the Morder Intelligence firm to project a CAGR of 6.4% for the Asia-Pacific Military Aviation market in the 2024-2030 period. Such estimates suggest enormous expansion prospects for major combat aircraft makers such as Lockheed, which enjoys a solid presence in this market.\r\n\r\nTLMAL is currently engaged in manufacturing the F-21 advanced multirole fighter aircraft, while the MH-60R is presently the largest program for LMT in India. Outside India, Lockheed has a solid presence in other parts of Asia-Pacific, which include Singapore, Japan and Australia.\n\nOpportunities for LMT\u2019s Peers\n\nA few other defense players that can gain from the expanding military aviation market in the Asia-Pacific region are The Boeing Company BA, Airbus Group EADSY and Northrop Grumman NOC.\r\n\r\nBoeing has a strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region. It has supplied combat jets to India, which include a range of combat-proven aircraft like the AH-64 Apache, P-8I Poseidon, C-17 Globemaster III and CH-47 Chinook.\r\n\r\nBoeing has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 21.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA\u2019s third-quarter 2024 sales suggests year-over-year growth of 10.8%.\r\n\r\nAirbus is one of the biggest suppliers of combat jets for the Asia-Pacific region. The company is providing the IAF with several military aircraft, including the C295 and the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport.\r\n\r\nEADSY has a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 5.4%.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman has several military aircraft that are used in the Asia-Pacific region. The company has supplied the F-35A, F-20 and RQ-4B Global Hawk, used by Japan and South Korea.\r\n\r\nNorthrop has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales implies an improvement of 5.4% from the prior-year figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nLMT Stock Outperforms Industry\n\nIn the past six months, shares of Lockheed Martin have risen 30.4% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 3.3%.

As part of this new program, the company will immediately start repurchasing an additional $100 million in shares under the 10b5-1 program, which it also plans to finish by year-end. CW will have $300 million in open repurchase authorization left once the combined $150 million share repurchase plans are finished.\n\nBenefits of Share Repurchases\n\nA share repurchase shows that the company believes its shares are undervalued and is an efficient method of putting money back into shareholders\u2019 pockets.

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Lockheed (LMT): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Lockheed Martin (LMT).\n\nLockheed currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.\n\nOf the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 52.6% and 5.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for LMT Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for LMT\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Lockheed here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Lockheed, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs LMT a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Lockheed, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $26.49.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Lockheed. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Lockheed.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's defence ministry said on Friday it was aiming for delivery of the first new F-16V fighter jets by the end of this year, blaming \"acute fluctuations\" in the international situation for delays in the island receiving them.\n\nThe United States in 2019 approved an $8 billion sale of Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a deal that would take the island's F-16 fleet to more than 200 jets, the largest in Asia, to strengthen its defences in the face of a stepped up threat from China, which views Taiwan as its own.\n\nTaiwan has been converting 141 F-16A/B jets into the F-16V type and has ordered 66 new F-16Vs, which have advanced avionics, weapons and radar systems to better face down the Chinese air force, including its J-20 stealth fighter.\n\nBut Taiwan has complained of delays for the new F-16Vs, saying problems include software issues.\n\nIn an update on the deliveries, Taiwan's defence ministry said the first batch of new F-16Vs was meant to have been sent in the third quarter of this year.\n\n\"Because of acute fluctuations in the international situation, which have resulted in a compound impact such as delays in deliveries of some suppliers and adjustments to the U.S. assembly schedule, there has been a partial adjustment in when they will leave the factory,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe ministry will \"strive to complete the shipment of the first aircraft in the fourth quarter\".\n\nThe air force will keep a close watch on the production schedule and make factory visits with the aim to have the deliveries completed by the end of 2026, it added.\n\nLockheed Martin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTaiwan has reported delays to U.S. weapons deliveries such as Stinger anti-aircraft missiles since 2022, as manufacturers give supplies to Ukraine to help it battle Russian forces, and the issue has concerned U.S. lawmakers.\n\nTaiwan's air force is well-trained but some of its fighter jets are aging, including its French-made fleet of Mirage 2000s first received in 1997. One crashed into the sea this week during a training exercise.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe air force has repeatedly scrambled to see off Chinese military aircraft flying near the island in the past five years.\n\nTaiwan's government rejects China's sovereignty claims.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Stephen Coates)",
