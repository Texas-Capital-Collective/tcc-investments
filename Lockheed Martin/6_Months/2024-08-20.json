Elevated mortgage rates \u2013 seen as a function of interest rates at a 22-year high and inflation, which is eating away into disposable income \u2013 are constraining purchases. In the wake of all this, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) CEO John Ketchum recently lauded Florida as a thriving market for housing as well as commercial and industrial construction.\n\nRead More:\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the next NVIDIA \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10. **This is a paid advertisement.

Despite California having the twice as many residents, Florida has nearly double the number of home listings, said Realtor.com in a recent report. It is a bellwether state \"consistently attracting people from around the globe due to its significant tax advantages, perfect weather, and booming economy,\"\u00a0 Jenny Lenz, the managing director of Dolly Lenz Real Estate, told the website.\n\nThe report characterized the housing market in the state as split, with condominium prices on the coasts falling due to high insurance costs and assessment fees, while single-family home cost remained steady inland.\n\nRecent data from Redfin showed that the median sale price of a home in Florida rose 2.3% year-over-year to $419,200, lower than the nationwide median price of $426,900. Although marking a decline from the April 2024 peak, home prices are still near the record levels, the real-estate company said. That said, the number of homes sold fell 14.1%, while inventory rose 16%.\n\nWhile all roads led to Florida following the pandemic due to the state's pulling points, things are changing now, a U.S. News report said. The deterrents are the expensive homeowner's insurance due to hurricane threat in the state, higher home prices and the increase in property taxes.\n\nCommercial Real Estate \u2013 Risks & Opportunities\n\nAfter a tough year in 2023, the commercial real estate market nationwide is expected to bounce back this year as the Fed is widely expected to cut rates this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nA report from the National Association of Realtors noted a troubled office sector, with falling lending activity and rising office availability and delinquencies. The office vacancy rate nationwide rose to a new record of 13.8% in February, it said. Leasing activity, a proxy for demand and interest, has dropped about 50 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels. Among other commercial real estate segments, multi-family was recovering from lows, retail spaces continued to slowdown and the industrial segment is showing signs of a slowdown.\n\nNAR's report flagged a sharp increase in rent for industrial spaces in Florida cities such as Orlando, Jacksonville and Tampa, with the spike attributed to strong demand for warehouse properties. The increases are in the magnitude of 10% from last year, it said.\n\nThat said, there is a looming risk. The low financing costs buyers are availing now could soon become a thing of the past, said Godfrey Legal. It reasoned that many loans on commercial properties will mature later this year and in the upcoming year, with about $1.5 trillion in commercial real estate debt maturing. The terms of fresh loans or refinancing will likely be tougher.\n\nRead More:\n\nWhen today\u2019s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them \u2014 here\u2019s how not to get left out.

The state also boasts of the highest population growth and it attracts remote workers due to the low cost of living, especially in northeast Florida, said Forbes contributor Gilda D'Incerti.\n\nPotential Beneficiaries: With industry players and watchers betting on Florida's housing and commercial real estate markets, real estate and utility companies operating in the state stand to gain big.
