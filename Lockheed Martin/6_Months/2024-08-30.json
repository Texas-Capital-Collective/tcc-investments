        "content": "Friday, August 30, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), AT&T Inc. (T) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), as well as two micro-cap stocks Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP) and Natural Resource Partners L.P. (NRP). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have lost some ground following the beat-and-raise quarterly release on Wednesday, August 28th, with market participants seemingly shrugging the company's raised guidance. But this lack of stock market follow through for the shares could very well be a reflection of the stock's impressive gains over the past year rather than a comment on underlying busines trends.\n\nThe company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\u00a0\r\n\r\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. \r\n\r\nHowever, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds. The United States and China\u2019s tit-for-tat trade war is also a major concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of AT&T have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the year-to-date period (+23.4% vs. +21.7%). The company is expected to benefit from an integrated fiber expansion strategy that improves broadband connectivity, while steady 5G deployments are likely to boost end-user experience. The deployment of O-RAN architecture is likely to offer more flexibility, lower costs and monetize the network to reduce huge debt burden. \r\n\r\nWith a customer-centric business model, AT&T is witnessing healthy momentum in its postpaid wireless business with a lower churn rate and increased adoption of higher-tier unlimited plans. However, lower demand for legacy voice and data services is affecting revenues in the Business Wireline vertical. \r\n\r\nDeclining Mobility equipment sales are a concern. Fierce competition in a saturated wireless market will likely strain margins. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome while high debt burden remains a perennial problem.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AT&T here >>>)\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+29.1% vs. +1.9%). The company\u2019s broad product offerings allow it to secure major defense contracts, which in turn boosts its backlog count. Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. \r\n\r\nThe solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Its products also witness a strong international demand from the countries like Germany, Taiwan, Japan and Australia. Meanwhile, the company also holds a strong solvency position. \r\n\r\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact the company\u2019s operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Steel Partners\u2019 have declined -2.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry\u2019s decline of -7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $795.34 million reported strong financial results in second-quarter 2024, with revenues growing 6.4% year over year to $533.2 million and a 113.2% surge in net income to $124.9 million.\r\n\r\nRevenues for the six months ended Jun 30, 2024 also increased by 6.7% to $1 billion. This growth reflects the company's effective diversification across its industrial and financial services segments. SPLP's operational efficiency is highlighted by a 15.7% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 14.7% in second-quarter 2023. \r\n\r\nSteel Partners\u2019 balance sheet is robust, with $256.4 million in cash and a $112-million debt reduction in the first half of 2024, enhancing financial stability. Investments in the Supply Chain segment, which saw 192% in revenues for the six months ended Jun 30, 2024, position SPLP for long-term growth, particularly as global supply chains evolve.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Steel Partners here >>>)\r\n\r\nNatural Resource Partners\u2019 shares have declined -0.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Coal industry\u2019s decline of -2.4%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $1.13 billion faces significant risks from its heavy reliance on coal royalties, with metallurgical coal accounting for 75% of second-quarter 2024 coal royalty revenues. \r\n\r\nWeakened steel demand, particularly in China and Europe, is pressuring coal prices, potentially reducing NRP's cash flow. The secular decline in U.S. thermal coal demand, driven by environmental regulations and competition from natural gas, further threatens long-term revenues. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, a surge in Chinese soda ash production is depressing global prices, impacting NRP's profitability. Inflationary pressures, labor shortages, and high financing costs also pose challenges, while stringent environmental regulations and reliance on lessees increase operational risks. Overall, NRP's exposure to volatile coal markets and regulatory risks positions it in a challenging environment.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Resource Partners here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Boeing Company (BA), The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW) and MetLife, Inc. (MET).\r\n\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT and Raytheon, part of RTX Corporation RTX, have been awarded a $1.3 billion follow-on contract by the U.S. Army for Javelin missiles. These missiles have played a significant role in Ukraine's defense. This latest agreement, which builds on a larger contract from last year, could total up to $7.2 billion for an indefinite quantity of missiles between 2023 and 2026.\r\n\r\nThe companies have been increasing Javelin production to meet rising demand and aim to achieve an annual manufacturing capacity of around 4,000 missiles by 2026. The new contract includes the production of more than 4,000 Javelins, mainly to replenish Javelin missile stock that has been sent to support Ukraine.\n\nIncreasing Usage of LMT and RTX\u2019s Javelin Missiles\n\nThe joint venture (JV) between Lockheed Martin and Raytheon is a powerful alliance in the defense industry. These two defense companies have collaborated on various defense projects, with the Javelin missile system being one of their most successful projects. This JV brings together LMT\u2019s extensive experience in missile production and Raytheon\u2019s advanced technology in defense systems, thereby enabling it to meet the U.S. Army's requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Javelin missile is a versatile, shoulder-fired weapon system known for its precision and effectiveness on the battlefield. It automatically guides itself to the target after launch, allowing the gunner to take cover and avoid counterfire. Soldiers or marines using the missile can reposition immediately after firing, or reload to engage another threat. It has been widely used by U.S. forces and allied nations and is currently utilized in Ukraine. The missile\u2019s ability to engage multiple targets, including tanks and fortified positions, has made it an essential tool for modern warfare.\n\nLMT\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nLockheed Martin secures major defense contracts with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its total backlog was a solid $158.34 billion as of June 30, 2024. The company continues to win defense contracts and support the defense departments of the United States and other allied nations.\r\n\r\nThe global defense sector is seeing strong growth driven by rising geopolitical tensions and the need for advanced military capabilities. The demand for U.S. weaponry, including shoulder-mounted Javelin systems is on the rise, which will further boost LMT\u2019s performance.\n\nProspects of LMT\u2019s Defense Peers\n\nOther defense companies that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding defense market have been discussed below.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation NOC develops and builds some of the world\u2019s most advanced missile defense technology, from command systems to directed energy weapons, advanced munitions and powerful sensors.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Gruman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 5.4%.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation GD is a manufacturer and integrator of land solutions including wheeled and tracked combat vehicles, weapon systems and munitions.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.6%. The consensus estimate for GD\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 13.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLMT\u2019s Stock Price Movement\n\nShares of LMT have gained 21.4% in the past three months, compared with the industry\u2019s 5.6% growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLMT\u2019s Zacks Rank\n\nLMT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "Readers hoping to buy Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. In other words, investors can purchase Lockheed Martin's shares before the 3rd of September in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of September.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$3.15 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$12.60 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Lockheed Martin has a trailing yield of approximately 2.2% on its current stock price of US$566.85. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Lockheed Martin paying out a modest 45% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 44% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Lockheed Martin, with earnings per share up 9.8% on average over the last five years. The company is retaining more than half of its earnings within the business, and it has been growing earnings at a decent rate. We think this is generally an attractive combination, as dividends can grow through a combination of earnings growth and or a higher payout ratio over time.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Lockheed Martin has delivered 9.0% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nIs Lockheed Martin an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Lockheed Martin is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but Lockheed Martin is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. There's a lot to like about Lockheed Martin, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.\n\nIn light of that, while Lockheed Martin has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example - Lockheed Martin has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.\n\nA common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.
