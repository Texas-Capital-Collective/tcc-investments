        "content": "In the latest trading session, Lockheed Martin (LMT) closed at $577.94, marking a -0.12% move from the previous day. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.19%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.04%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the aerospace and defense company had gained 3.25% over the past month, outpacing the Aerospace sector's gain of 1.86% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.95% in that time.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Lockheed Martin in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $6.40, reflecting a 5.47% decrease from the same quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $17.45 billion, indicating a 3.37% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $26.49 per share and revenue of $71.14 billion, which would represent changes of -4.78% and +5.28%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Lockheed Martin. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.08.\n\nOne should further note that LMT currently holds a PEG ratio of 4.67.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Secures a Contract for HELLFIRE II Missiles &amp; JAGM",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT recently secured a modification contract valued at $42 million to provide HELLFIRE II Missiles and Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGM). The work related to this deal will be carried out in Orlando, FL, and is projected to be completed by Sept. 30, 2027.\r\n\r\nThe award has been provided by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring LMT?\n\nWith countries worldwide enhancing their defense capabilities, spending on advanced military arms and ammunition has been rapidly increasing. This also includes growing investments in missiles and missile systems, which are crucial for warfare missions. Lockheed Martin, as a prominent manufacturer of missiles and missile defense systems, has thus been witnessing a steady flow of orders from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies. The latest contract win is an example of that.\r\n \r\nNotably, Lockheed Martin\u2019s HELLFIRE II missile provides precision-strike accuracy across multiple missions and targets. It offers maximum flexibility in combat. Its versatility ensures effective performance in a wide range of operational scenarios.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, LMT\u2019s JAGM combines the capabilities of the HELLFIRE and LONGBOW missiles into one system, providing multi-domain combat solutions. Its fire-and-forget feature enhances user survivability and allows for rapid attacks on multiple targets, thereby making it a crucial weapon against evolving global threats.\r\n\r\nSuch notable features of the aforementioned missiles of Lockheed Martin are likely to have been boosting their demand, which is further evident from the latest contract win.\n\nLMT Stock\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nRising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes have led nations to increase their focus on national security, particularly on missile defense systems, backed by the rapid development of advanced missile technologies over the last decade.\r\n \r\nThis is likely to have prompted Mordor Intelligence to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 5% for the missiles and missile defense systems market during the 2024-2029 time period.\r\n\r\nThis should benefit Lockheed Martin, with its Missile and Fire Control unit being a recognized developer of high-performance missiles. The unit also pursues business in more than 50 countries worldwide. Some of its major programs are the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense air and missile defense programs as well. Its prominent missiles include Precision Strike Missile, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile and Long Range AntiShip Missile.\n\nStory continues\n\nProspects of LMT\u2019s Peers\n\nOther defense companies that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding missiles and missile system market have been discussed below.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation NOC: Northrop Grumman provides high-speed, long-range strike weapons like the AARGM-ER, which is a supersonic, air-launched tactical missile system. It also develops and builds advance missile defense technology, ranging from command systems to directed energy weapons, advanced munitions and powerful sensors.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 5.4%.\r\n\r\nRTX Corporation RTX: It is known for its missile defense systems like the Patriot and SM-6, which are in high demand globally. RTX also provides advanced sensors and interceptors to identify, track and defeat threats as part of a layered missile defense.\r\n \r\nThe company\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 10.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 7%.\r\n\r\nThe Boeing Company BA: It manufactures various missile defense systems, including the Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Avenger. Boeing-built and supported air and missile defense systems have been protecting its customers for nearly 25 years against threats ranging from intercontinental ballistic missiles to hostile aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 21.3%.\u00a0 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA\u2019s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 21.7%.\n\nLMT Stock\u2019s Price Movement\n\nShares of LMT have gained 25.3% in the past three months compared with the industry\u2019s 7.3% growth.
