        "title": "How Intuitive Machines 'totally disrupted' the economics of flying to the moon",
        "content": "Intuitive Machines (LUNR) made history in February when it became the first private space company to touch down on the surface of the moon.\n\nNow, it\u2019s looking to accelerate the development of the lunar economy.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance, Intuitive Machines CEO and co-founder Steve Altemus said the company\u2019s cost structure and ability to streamline lunar missions ultimately place it in the driver\u2019s seat in a global race to develop the moon.\n\n\u201cWe designed and developed a mission to the moon at a price point that was roughly $118 million and did it in about four years,\u201d Altemus said. \u201cWe have totally disrupted the industry in terms of the economics of flying to the moon.\u201d The Intuitive Machines IM-1 Lunar Lander, Nova-C, is on display on Oct. 3, 2023, before it is shipped to Cape Canaveral, Florida, for launch on a Falcon 9 rocket.

That cut short Intuitive Machines' full mission, although the NASA research equipment on board successfully sent back data from its experiments.\n\nIntuitive Machines is now looking ahead to its second lunar mission, IM-2, which is scheduled for November. Altemus said the company conducted a 30-day review of its first mission to improve its technology for the second round.\n\n\u201cWe can improve our ability to land 20 times with precision,\u201d Altemus said. \u201cThe south pole [of the moon] is going to require that. That's what we do continually \u2014 refine for that pinpoint accuracy.\u201d\n\nIntuitive Machines is among a handful of private startups developing a low-cost transportation system to the moon with funding from NASA. The agency\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program set aside $2.6 billion for more than a dozen companies to carry NASA\u2019s research to the lunar surface along with payloads for commercial customers.

The first crewed mission under Artemis has been delayed to 2025 as Lockheed Martin (LMT), the lead contractor, develops the Orion spacecraft that will carry the astronauts.\n\nIntuitive Machines, meanwhile, is positioning itself to own end-to-end operations between the Earth and the moon, strategically placing bets on the critical infrastructure needed to enable longer stays on the lunar surface.\n\nThe company recently won a $30 million contract from NASA to develop a lunar terrain vehicle that will shuttle Artemis astronauts around on the moon. Intuitive Machines has also developed a Lunar Data Network that enables communication and data relay services for spacecraft.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAs a company, our vision is to deliver space systems to the surface with our family of landers to do command and control and navigation in and around the moon so that it enables surface operations,\u201d Altemus said. \u201cI believe Intuitive Machines is the only company that's got all three pieces.\u201d\n\nNASA estimates human activity in the region of space between the Earth and the moon will exceed all activity since 1957 in the next decade alone. That potential prompted the White House to develop its first science and technology strategy to \u201csupport responsible, peaceful, and sustainable exploration.\u201d\n\nThe relative success of its first mission has provided a lift to Intuitive Machines. The company saw its cash balance increase to $54.6 million in the first three months of the year after an institutional investor exercised warrants. The company also raised $10 million through equity and said it had \u201csufficient capital for the near term.\u201d\n\nIntuitive Machines stock is up roughly 138% year to date. But the company, which came to the public markets through a SPAC, has been more vulnerable to big swings on any perceived risks compared to competitors that have opted to remain private.\n\n\u201cWhen you go de-SPAC, there's quite a bit of volatility in your stock as you move from maybe retail investors to more institutional investors,\u201d Altemus said. \u201cSo as the company matures, I see a greater contribution of investment from institutional investors, which should provide some stability to the stock in the long term.\u201d\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "10 Weakest Militaries in Asia",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 10 weakest militaries in Asia. You can skip our detailed analysis of the current defense spending trends in the continent, and head over directly to the 5 Weakest Militaries in Asia.\n\nAccording to the latest figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), global military spending registered its steepest rise since 2009, increasing 6.8% from 2022 to total $2.44 trillion in 2023. This was the ninth successive year in which the world\u2019s military spending had risen, with all major regions, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia witnessing an increase.\n\nIn 2023, $560 billion was spent on defense across Asia, increasing 3.6% year over year. Of this, $411 billion was incurred in East Asia, which represented 73% of the continent\u2019s total defense spending. On the other hand, defense spending in South Asia was recorded at $98.2 billion, whereas $47.8 billion was expensed in Southeast Asia. The least expenditure in the continent was noticed in Central Asia, where only $1.8 billion was spent during the year.\n\nDefense expenditure in Asia has risen by more than 40% since 2014, with a sharp rise being observed in East Asia and South Asia \u2013 the two major flashpoints of military and diplomatic escalation in the continent. Countries in the region have gotten embroiled in an arms race, and the resultant surge in demand for weapons has created a boom in the global armaments industry.\n\nAccording to defense experts, the threat of China invading and annexing Taiwan is greater today than it ever was, with Beijing steadily stockpiling its arsenal for the last few decades. In response, the United States, in order to protect its own and Taipei\u2019s interests, has ramped up its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region. Washington has also recently approved sales of weapons worth billions of dollars to Taiwan. In March last year, in a move that soured the relationship further between the United States and China, the American government approved selling new weapons worth $619 million to Taiwan, which included 200 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and 100 AGM-88B HARM missiles, among others. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) are the primary contractors of the deal.\n\nThe arms race between South Korea and North Korea also does not seem to have an end in sight any soon. Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime has been a thorn in Seoul\u2019s side, and has launched over a hundred ballistic missiles over the last two years, signaling Pyongyang's intentions of not relinquishing its weapons of mass destruction. South Korea in response increased its defense spending by 3.6% last year compared to 2022, incurring $47.9 billion in 2023, which included an order placed in September for 25 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) valued at $5.06 billion. According to Yonhap News Agency, Seoul had already acquired another 40 F-35s from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) between 2019 and 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe South China Sea continues to remain a point of contention between regional and global powers, with Beijing laying a claim over nearly all of its strategic waterways, while Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines have overlapping claims as well. South Asia also remains hot, as Pakistan and India continue to pile up their arsenals in what is termed as the most weaponized region in the world. The arch-rivals regularly launch newer, improved missiles, and showcase their latest military equipment in parade ceremonies and drills to flaunt their war capabilities to the other.\n\nCountries in the Middle East have also been heavily upgrading their military capabilities to enhance national security, especially after the jolts faced by the Arab Spring in the early 2010s. Saudi Arabia has remained the fifth largest defense spender in the world for two successive years now \u2013 2022 and 2023 \u2013 with over $75 billion incurred in military spending in each of these years, including a $3 billion agreement with the United States to purchase 300 MIM-104E Patriot missiles from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX). There are also reports about RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) moving the production of parts involved in manufacturing the Patriot missiles to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAll said and done, while defense spending continues to expand significantly in Asia, the increase has not been even within the continent, as was evident from the breakdown of military spending in Asia shared earlier in the discussion. There are regions and countries in the continent where defense expenditure, sizes and inventories of militaries remain small, because of which, these are some of the weakest militaries in Asia.\n\nWe now take a look at these countries. If interested, you can also read our article on the 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Asia. 10 Weakest Militaries in Asia\n\niurii/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have considered three broad weighted categories to rank the weakest militaries in Asia. These include the strength of ground troops in terms of manpower, tanks, and armored fighting vehicles (30%), size of the economy and defense spending (30%), and aerial and naval capabilities (40%). Weighted scores for each metric were aggregated to get a final overall score. The 10 weakest militaries in Asia are ranked in descending order of these scores.\n\nData related to military equipment and defense spending has been sourced from the Global Firepower Index 2024, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), and other independent news agencies of various countries. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was consulted for figures related to countries\u2019 GDP.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Lebanon\n\nGDP (2023): $21.78 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $241.3 million\n\nActive Manpower: 60,000\n\nTanks: 204\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 4,522\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 81\n\nNaval Assets: 69\n\nOverall Score: 9.0\n\nWe begin with Lebanon, which has the weakest military in the Middle East, and one that faces an asymmetric threat from non-state actors, including militant groups. A major challenge impeding the potential of the Lebanese military is its shortage of logistical equipment and a lack of financial resources. The country\u2019s air force also remains weak, with only nine combat aircraft; the rest of the fleet comprising attack helicopters and transport aircraft.\n\n9. Armenia\n\nGDP (2023): $24.54 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $1.33 billion\n\nActive Manpower: 57,500\n\nTanks: 221\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 736\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 64\n\nNaval Assets: 0\n\nOverall Score: 7.6\n\nNext on our list is Armenia. The country has significantly increased its manpower and defense spending in wake of the armed conflict with Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh region in 2020. Despite that Armenia\u2019s military capabilities remain limited, and the results in the conflict in which it ended up losing territory reflects its weaknesses. The country has a small fleet of battle tanks and military aircraft, and has no naval assets. It has a force of 57,500 personnel when it comes to active military manpower.\n\n8. Laos\n\nGDP (2023): $14.24 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $40 million\n\nActive Manpower: 100,000\n\nTanks: 130\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 1,880\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 34\n\nNaval Assets: 45\n\nOverall Score: 6.4\n\nLaos is the only landlocked country in Southeast Asia, with a population of 7.5 million people. It has the weakest military in Southeast Asia and one of the weakest in Asia, with only 130 battle tanks, 34 military aircraft, and 45 naval assets. It has a sizable number of active military personnel and a large fleet of armored fighting vehicles; however, these are not sufficient to help the country to shrug off its reputation of being a weak link when it comes to military strength in the continent.\n\n7. Nepal\n\nGDP (2023): $41.34 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $418.9 million\n\nActive Manpower: 95,000\n\nTanks: 0\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 2,216\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 15\n\nNaval Assets: 0\n\nOverall Score: 6.2\n\nNepal is one of the weakest militaries in Asia with no battle tanks and naval assets. Its fleet of armored fighting vehicles is the country's only recognizable area of military strength. The military aircraft fleet of Nepal includes no combat aircraft, with all 15 of these aircraft either being transport jets or combat helicopters.\u00a0Nepal relies heavily on India for most of its military equipment.\u00a0Due to the country\u2019s weak military, there has been growing concern in India over Nepal becoming a hub for cross-border spying against Delhi\u2019s security interests.\n\n6. Afghanistan\n\nGDP (2023): $14.94 billion\n\nDefense Spending (2023): $278.3 million\n\nActive Manpower: 80,000\n\nTanks: 20\n\nArmored Fighting Vehicles: 6,555\n\nMilitary Aircraft: 17\n\nNaval Assets: 0\n\nOverall Score: 5.8\n\nAfghanistan is sixth on our list of the weakest militaries in Asia. After the collapse of Ashraf Ghani\u2019s government in 2021, the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) were replaced by the Taliban\u2019s Islamic Emirate Armed Forces as the national military of the country. Most of the military equipment in Afghanistan\u2019s inventory, especially the armored fighting vehicles, is what was left behind by the American-led coalition. Afghanistan has no naval assets, only 17 military aircraft, and 20 battle tanks, according to the Global Firepower Index. There has been a scarcity of information that comes out Kabul after the Taliban takeover, but rough estimates suggest the group has about 80,000 fighters that now form part of the national military.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Weakest Militaries in Asia.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Weakest Militaries in the World 10 Weakest Militaries in Europe 10 Weakest Militaries in Africa\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Weakest Militaries in Asia is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",
