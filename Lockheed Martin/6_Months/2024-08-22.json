        "content": "This article looks at countries that receive the most US foreign military aid. You can skip our detailed analysis of how Washington has aided its allies amid security challenges in recent years, and head over directly to the U.S. Foreign Military Aid by Country: Top 5 Countries.\n\nGlobal military spending reached a record high of $2.44 trillion in 2023, having grown 6.8% compared to the year before. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), this is the biggest percentage spike in defense expenditure since 2009 and the ninth consecutive fiscal year during which military spending has increased.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Countries That Provided the Highest Military Aid to Ukraine and 25 Countries That Receive the Most Foreign Aid From the US.\n\nThe United States spent $916 billion on defense last year, representing 37.5% of the global military expenditure. The figure also amounted to 68% of NATO\u2019s total defense bill during the year. A considerable portion of the overall spending from Washington went to providing military assistance to Ukraine in its war against Russia, and in aiding Israel as it advances against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. In April this year, President Biden signed into law a $95 billion war aid assistance package for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and other countries in global hot spots. According to Reuters, much of this is expected to go into the procurement of pricey, advanced military equipment from aerospace and defense giants such as Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and more.\n\nThe surge in global military spending amid the volatile situation in Europe and the Middle East has created a boom in the defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s share price has spiked 55% since Russia invaded Ukraine, from $361 in February 2022 to its current level of $558 per share, due to strong demand for its weapons, such as HIMARS, GMLRS, and the F-35. The company generated over $67 billion in revenues in 2023, of which an estimated 96% was defense-related. With no immediate end to the conflicts in sight, the stock is set to further strengthen. According to Insider Monkey, 47 hedge funds were bullish about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)\u2019s shares have also soared 33% since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. Last month, the company finalized a co-production agreement with a Ukrainian firm Ukroboronservice to manufacture medium-caliber ammunition in the country. Under the contract, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) will provide equipment and training to Ukroboronservice to establish an assembly line in the country to produce and test these weapons.\n\nOn the other hand, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is currently working on a 2022 contract worth $927 million to deliver Israel's four KC-46A Pegasus aircraft in the next few years. The company also accelerated work on an order for 1,000 small-diameter bombs for Israel, under a contract signed in 2021, after Hamas launched an attack on Israel in October last year.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is flying high as well amid strong financial results. The company posted a revenue of $69 billion in 2023 and has made a robust start to the first half of the ongoing fiscal year. During the first quarter, it generated $19.3 billion in sales and an EPS of $1.34, which was 10% higher YoY. The company fared even better in the second quarter, registering a revenue of $19.8 billion and an EPS of $1.41.\n\nAnticipating a sustained demand for its weapons and other offerings, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has revised its full-year outlook with total revenue now forecast between $78.5 to $79.5 billion, up from the prior range of $78 to $79 billion. The company has also revised its EPS expectations to between $5.35 - $5.45, compared to $5.25 - $5.40 in the earlier quarter. It is one of the best defense stocks to buy right now.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Secures a Deal to Aid H-60 Black Hawk helicopters",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT business unit, Sikorsky, recently clinched a contract to conduct configurations for various H-60 Black Hawk helicopters. Work related to this deal is expected to be completed by Aug 21, 2029.\n\nValued at $97.3 million, the contract has been awarded by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\n\nWhat Offers Lockheed an Edge?\n\nLockheed's H-60 fleet of Black Hawk multirole helicopters is a vital asset for the U.S. military and the armed forces of 34 other nations. Equipped with digital avionics, powerful GE engines, durable airframe structures and composite wide-chord rotor blades, the modern BLACK HAWK platform offers enhanced survivability and situational awareness. It also boasts the ability to fly higher and carry more than its predecessors.\n\nThe helicopter's advanced weapon system enables pilots to identify and engage both stationary and moving targets using forward-firing guns, rockets and laser-guided air-to-ground missiles.\n\nThese impressive features likely contribute to the strong order flow that Lockheed continues to receive, as seen in the latest contract.\n\nWith more than 4,000 BLACK HAWK aircraft of various types in service globally, the demand for Lockheed's H-60 helicopters remains robust in the combat helicopter market. This strong demand is expected to lead to more contract wins for Lockheed, like the latest one, potentially boosting revenue growth for its Sikorsky business unit in the near future.\n\nLMT\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nRecent advancements and the integration of new tactical, logistical, and essential features have significantly increased the prominence and demand for U.S. military helicopters. As a leading combat helicopter manufacturer, Lockheed is well-positioned to benefit from this trend, consistently securing helicopter delivery and service contracts from the Pentagon and U.S. allies. The recent contract award is a prime example of this success.\n\nLooking forward, escalating geopolitical tensions and cross-border conflicts worldwide are driving nations to boost defense spending on new aircraft and helicopters to strengthen their aerial capabilities. According to a report by the Mordor Intelligence firm, the military helicopters market is projected to witness a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.9% between 2024 and 2030.\n\nThis should significantly boost Lockheed\u2019s performance, as the company enjoys a dominant position in the military helicopter market with its portfolio containing combat-proven programs like Black Hawk, MH-60R Seahawk, HH-60W Combat Rescue, CH-148 Cyclone, S-97 Raider and CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopters.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nOther defense companies that should enjoy the perks of the expanding military helicopter market have been discussed below.\n\nBoeing BA: The company\u2019s helicopters are renowned for their leading-edge, ready and relevant solutions that deliver proven capabilities. Boeing\u2019s product portfolio includes combat helicopters and rotorcraft like CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, AH-6 Little Bird and V-22 Osprey.\n\nBoeing has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 21.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA\u2019s third-quarter 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 2.5% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nAirbus Group EADSY: It is one of the world's largest suppliers of advanced military helicopters. Its product portfolio includes the H135 combat helicopter, the H145M helicopter, AS565 MBe Panther, H160M, H175M, H215M, H225M and a few more.\n\nAirbus\u2019 long-term earnings growth rate is 13.9%. The consensus estimate for EADSY\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 7.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nTextron TXT: Its Bell unit is one of the leading suppliers of helicopters to the U.S. government. In association with Boeing, this unit is the only supplier of military tiltrotor aircraft. Some of TXT\u2019s key programs are AH-1Z helicopter, V-22 tiltrotor, V-247 and V280 aircraft.\n\nTextron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 5.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of Lockheed have surged 21.8% against the industry\u2019s decline of 2.3%.

        "title": "Why Is Lockheed (LMT) Up 7.5% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Lockheed Martin (LMT). Shares have added about 7.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Lockheed due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nLockheed Beats on Q2 Earnings, Ups '24 Sales View\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation\u00a0reported second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $7.11 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.45 by 10.2%. The bottom line also improved 5.6% from the year-ago quarter's recorded figure of $6.73.\n\nThe company reported GAAP earnings of $6.85 per share compared with $6.63 in the prior-year period.\n\nThe year-over-year bottom-line improvement can be attributed to solid sales growth and operating profit improvement from the second quarter of 2023.\n\nOperational Highlights\n\nNet sales were $18.12 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.10 billion by 6%. The top line also increased 8.6% from $16.69 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe year-over-year top-line improvement can be attributed to sales growth from each of the four company segments.\n\nBacklog\n\nLMT\u2019s backlog as of Jun 30, 2024, was $158.34 billion compared with $159.37 billion at the end of first-quarter 2024.\n\nOur model projected a backlog worth $179.34 billion for the second quarter.\n\nThe Aeronautics segment accounted for $53.03 billion of the total backlog amount, while Rotary and Mission Systems contributed $37.36 billion. The Missiles and Fire Control segment contributed $34.83 billion, while the Space unit accounted for $33.11 billion.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nAeronautics: Sales improved 5.8% year over year to $7.28 billion. This was driven by sales growth from a higher volume on sustainment, development and production contracts for F-35 program, and ramped-up production of the F-16 program.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit improved 4.6% year over year to $751 million. The operating margin, however, contracted 10 basis points (bps) to 10.3%.\n\nMissiles and Fire Control: Quarterly sales improved a solid 12.6% year over year to $3.10 billion. This was on account of higher sales from tactical and strike missile programs, driven by a production ramp-up of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (\u201cGMLRS\u201d) and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (\u201cLRASM\u201d) programs.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit increased 21.3% year over year to $450 million. The operating margin of 14.5% expanded 100 bps from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpace: Sales rose 0.9% year over year to $3.20 billion due to higher sales from strategic and missile defense programs, driven by higher volume of the hypersonics and Fleet Ballistic Missile (\u201cFBM\u201d) programs.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit rose 10.9% to $346 million. The operating margin expanded 90 bps to 10.8%.\n\nRotary and Mission Systems: Quarterly revenues improved 16.7% to $4.55 billion on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily driven by higher net sales from integrated warfare systems and sensors programs. Higher net sales from Sikorsky helicopter programs also aided this segment\u2019s top line.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit rose 9% to $495 million in the reported quarter. The operating margin, however, deteriorated 70 bps to 10.9% in the said time frame.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nLockheed\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.52 billion at the end of second-quarter 2024 compared with $1.44 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nCash from operating activities amounted to $3.51 billion as of Jun 31, 2024, compared with $2.66 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nLong-term debt as of Jun 30, 2024, totaled $19.12 billion, up from $17.29 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nLockheed has partially raised its financial guidance for 2024. The company now expects to generate revenues in the range of $70.50-$71.50 billion, up from the prior guidance of $68.50-$70.00 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $69.80 billion, which lies below the company\u2019s updated guided range.\n\nLMT currently expects 2024 earnings per share (EPS) to be in the range of $26.10-$26.60, up from the earlier guidance of $25.65-$26.35. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s full-year EPS is pinned at $26.20, lower than the mid-point of the company\u2019s updated guidance.\n\nLockheed still expects to generate free cash flow in the range of $6.00-$6.30 billion and incur capital expenditures of $1.75 billion during 2024.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates review flatlined during the past month.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Lockheed has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nLockheed has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
