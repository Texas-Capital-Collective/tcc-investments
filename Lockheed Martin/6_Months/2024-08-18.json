        "content": "Rocket Lab (RKLB) CEO Peter Beck has positioned himself as an outsider since the company\u2019s inception in 2006. A New Zealand native with no college degree, Beck has long been seen as the anti-Elon Musk.\n\nHe often reminds employees: \u201cWe have no money, so we have to think.\u201d\n\nNow, with its Neutron rocket, a fully reusable medium-lift launch vehicle set to take off in mid-2025, Beck says he is poised to pose the most formidable threat to what he describes as a \u201ctechnical monopoly\u201d held by Elon Musk and SpaceX.\n\n\"50% [of Neutron] is to break the monopoly that\u2019s in medium launch right now,\" Beck told Yahoo Finance. \"50% is to be able to launch our own stuff into orbit. I think we have the right combination of expertise and execution to be a real competitor.\" Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck sits alongside a Rutherford rocket engine in Auckland, New Zealand, on Oct. 20, 2015.

Rocket Lab already delivers launch services through its Electron rocket, builds spacecraft and satellite components, and offers on-orbit management.\n\nYet, despite those successes, Neutron presents the biggest opportunity to exert influence in the industry. If Rocket Lab successfully carries out the launch according to its timeline, it would mark the fastest time to market for a commercially developed medium-class launch vehicle.\n\nMore importantly for Beck, it would inject new competition into a part of the industry SpaceX has largely had to itself.\n\n\u201cNobody can compete with Elon putting internet into space unless you have your own rocket and you have the ability to build whatever spacecraft you want,\u201d Beck said. He added that the company feels \u201cvery good\u201d about the launch date, following a successful \u201chot fire\u201d test of its new Archimedes engine.

So it makes sense that [Rocket Lab] is diversifying in the different business lines to support commercial space.\u201d Rocket Lab's Archimedes engine for the Neutron launch vehicle is shown on a test stand at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. (Rocket Lab) (Murielle Baker/Rocket Lab)\n\nRocket Lab has already pushed back its timeline for launch, which was originally scheduled for the end of 2024. But the company has taken aim at SpaceX even before takeoff.\n\nIn an interview last year, Rocket Lab CFO Adam Spice said the company would be aiming to match SpaceX on a cost-per-kilogram basis for satellite customers, adding that Neutron would target a \u201c$50 million to $55 million launch service cost\u201d compared with Falcon 9\u2019s $67 million price tag.\n\nThe pipeline for medium-to-heavy-lift rockets is growing. United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA), completed the inaugural flight for its heavy-lift Vulcan rocket in January, while the Ariane 6, backed by the European Space Agency, completed its first launch last month after years of delays. And Blue Origin\u2019s reusable New Glenn rocket is preparing for a September launch.\n\nThe increased competition is coming amid growing unease about SpaceX\u2019s dominance and influence over the industry, particularly among lawmakers. Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of 36 lawmakers sent a letter to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, calling on the Air Force to consider \u201cincreased competition among launch providers.\u201d SpaceX founder Elon Musk after a T-Mobile and SpaceX joint event on Aug. 25, 2022, in Boca Chica Beach, Texas. (Michael Gonzalez/Getty Images) (Michael Gonzalez via Getty Images)\n\nA New York Times analysis estimated that SpaceX has cumulatively been awarded $14.7 billion in federal launch prime contracts over the last decade.\n\n\u201cSpaceX has been wildly successful with the Falcon 9,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThe challenge with that is if you have a competing constellation that you want to launch to [rival] Starlink, some folks get a little bit uncomfortable with that. Of course, the government doesn't want all its eggs in one basket either. So it's really important we bring some balance to the market with Neutron.\u201d\n\nCompetition is also heating up outside of the US. Earlier this month, China launched its first satellite constellation into orbit, an initial step in a stated goal to challenge Starlink\u2019s hold on the market.\n\nBeck is quick to point out that two-thirds of Rocket Lab\u2019s business is in space systems, building satellites, and supplying components to customers. The proof, he said, is in the fact that 38% of everything that went into orbit last year had a Rocket Lab logo on it somewhere. On Friday, the company announced the shipment of two Mars-bound spacecraft set for launch in Cape Canaveral, Fla.\n\nA successful Neutron launch would pose the most direct challenge to Musk and SpaceX.\n\nIn the meantime, Beck says the industry is still in its infancy, with plenty of market share up for grabs, and maintains that companies who can\u2019t own the full stack won\u2019t survive.\n\n\u201cThe launch demand is coming from all directions, not just one or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cThe transformation or democratization of space that everybody has been talking about, we are truly into the thick of it.\u201d StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",
