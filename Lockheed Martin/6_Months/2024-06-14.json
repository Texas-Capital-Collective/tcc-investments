        "content": "Leidos Holdings, Inc. LDOS recently clinched a contract to offer the U.S. Air Force enterprise information technology (IT) and telecommunications support, including cybersecurity.\u00a0 The agreement is valued at $738 million. \r\n\r\nPer the terms of the contract, Leidos will provide cybersecurity, enterprise IT operations, IT asset management, program management and engineering services to all components of the Air Force in the national capital region, including the National Military Command Center.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring LDOS?\n\nAmid escalating geopolitical tensions worldwide, cyber security threats have been posing as a major risk factor to a nation\u2019s security. The necessity for secure and dependable networks to link fighters in the air and the operating base has become crucial as countries invest more in military cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nConsequently, as defense sectors across the board are focusing more on making their data transmission more secure, defense contractors like Leidos are witnessing solid contract flows involving the strengthening of cybersecurity capabilities. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\r\n\r\nThe growth potential of the Defense Cybersecurity industry is very strong due to the ever-changing and increasingly complex nature of cyberattacks. In light of this, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects that the global Defense Cybersecurity market will grow at a CAGR of 12.8% during the 2024-2029 period.\r\n\r\nSuch a solid market prediction offers strong growth opportunities to Leidos, which is a renowned provider of cybersecurity solutions to the federal government, boasting more than 30 years of experience in defending global cyber interests.\r\n\r\nLeidos\u2019 PACKIT (Proven, Analytic-Centric Kill Chain Implementation and Transformation) is a threat-based strategy for strengthening cyber security.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned -1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has lost 2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nLockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.26 points to a change of -5.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.37 indicates a change of +8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Lockheed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $17.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2%. The $69.72 billion and $72.44 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.2% and +3.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $17.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $6.33 for the same period compares with $6.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was +9.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "RTX Secures a Contract to Aid Silent Knight Radar Systems",
        "content": "RTX Corp. RTX recently secured a contract involving its Silent Knight radar systems. The award has been provided by the U.S. Special Operations Command, MacDill Air Force, FL.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $33.7 million, the contract has a ceiling amount of $293 million and is projected to be completed by Jun 14, 2030. Per the terms of the deal, RTX will provide sustainment, support, research, development and supplemental objectives related to the Silent Knight radar systems.\n\nBy offering these aids, RTX will support the U.S. Special Operations Command Program Executive Office-Fixed Wing, Special Operations Forces Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics-KF. Work related to this deal will be carried out in McKinney, TX.\n\nRTX & Radars\n\nWith the rapid escalation of geopolitical tensions globally in recent times, nations across the globe have been significantly boosting their defense arsenal. Since radars constitute a vital part of this arsenal, escalation in defense spending has been boosting investments in radars as well.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that while radars have been in use since World War II for locating threats and targets, they are being used today for multiple purposes like ground surveillance, missile control, fire control, moving target indication, weapons location and vehicle search.\n\nThis must have been ushering in solid order flow for radar manufacturing companies like RTX in the form of contract wins like the latest one. Notably, RTX\u2019s Silent Knight radar serves as a common multi-mode terrain following/terrain avoidance radar for a variety of platforms including the MH-47G helicopter, the lead aircraft for the program. It allows airborne forces safe low-level flight and safe ingress and egress in adverse environments. The system also provides navigation support, ground mapping and weather information to aircrews.\n\nRTX\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nThe demand for military radar systems has expanded manifold in recent times, driven by factors like the rise in defense spending of emerging economies, increase in regional tensions and inter-country conflicts that have boosted threats from missiles and aircraft.\n\nThis has set the stage for ample growth opportunities for the military radar market and must have prompted the Markets and Markets firm to project a CAGR of 4.7% during 2023-2027 for the global military radar market. Such growth projections bode well for prominent radar manufacturers like RTX.\n\nImpressively, RTX\u2019s product portfolio consists of varied radars like integrated air and missile defense radars, ballistic missile radars, surveillance radars as well as air dominance radars. Radars like AN-TPY-2, APG-79 and APG-82 are some of the company\u2019s combat-proven products that enjoy solid demand in the global military radar market, apart from AN/SPY-6.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nRTX apart, other defense contractors that are major radar manufacturers and thus expected to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the global military radar market are discussed below:\r\n\r\n Lockheed Martin LMT: Its radars are the choice of more than 45 nations on six continents. The company\u2019s product portfolio includes various radar systems like AN/APY-9 radar, airborne ground surveillance radar systems, AN/TPQ-53 radar systems, SPY-7, the long-range discrimination radar, FPS-117 and a few more.\n\nLockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.10%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings implies an improvement of 3.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nL3Harris Technologies LHX: The company manufactures combat-proven radars like SPS-48, land-based surveillance radar, AN/APY-11 Multimode radar, Tactical Air Surveillance radar, AN/SPS-48G Long range 3D surveillance radar and many more.\u00a0 Notably, its Vigilant family of software-defined, radar electronic support measures solutions is essential for survival and dominance in the electromagnetic threat environment of the modern battlefield.\n\nL3Harris boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings implies an improvement of 9.4% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: As a pioneer in Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars, NOC has been at the forefront of AESA innovations for more than 60 years. Its diverse product portfolio includes a handful of other radars like the F-35 fire control radar and the Distributed Aperture System, the LONGBOW Fire Control Radar, the Scalable Agile Beam Radar, the APR-39 DV (2), the EV(2) Radar Warning Receiver programs and a few more.\n\nNorthrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nThe company\u2019s shares have risen 11.4% in the past year against the industry\u2019s decline of 10.1%.
