        "content": "(Reuters) - RTX Corp's Pratt & Whitney said on Monday it has completed the preliminary design review for an engine upgrade to increase durability and performance in all three variants of the F-35 fighter jet.\n\nThe F-35 jet is manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp, accounting for about 27% of the company's sales.\n\nRTX received full funding from the U.S. government in March for its F135 engine core upgrade (ECU), which will modernize the F-35's propulsion system.\n\n\"Upgrading the F-35's propulsion system to ECU is a critical step toward ensuring the F-35 remains the world's premier air dominance fighter,\" Pratt & Whitney said.\n\nThe U.S. government had cleared Pratt & Whitney in February, allowing the company to resume deliveries of its F-135 engine for the F-35 fighter jet, after a halt was put in place in December following the discovery of a safety concern.\n\nIn May, the Department of Defense also resumed accepting F-35 jet deliveries from Lockheed Martin, after a brief halt starting late March due to a dispute over who would cover the costs related to fixing a production error discovered in 2017 that had caused corrosion.\n\n(Reporting by Ananta Agarwal in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "A Look Back at Defense Contractors Stocks' Q1 Earnings: CACI (NYSE:CACI) Vs The Rest Of The Pack\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season wraps, let's dig into this quarter's best and worst performers in the defense contractors industry, including CACI (NYSE:CACI) and its peers.\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 13 defense contractors stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.5%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.7% above consensus. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and defense contractors stocks have held roughly steady amidst all this, with share prices up 1% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nCACI (NYSE:CACI)\n\nFounded to commercialize SIMSCRIPT, CACI International (NYSE:CACI) offers defense, intelligence, and IT solutions to support national security and government transformation efforts.\n\nCACI reported revenues of $1.94 billion, up 11.1% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 4.4%.
