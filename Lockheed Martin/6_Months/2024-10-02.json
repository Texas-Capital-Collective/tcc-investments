        "title": "Is Lockheed Martin the Best Defense Stock to Buy After Middle East Attacks?",
        "content": "It\u2019s been great 2 plus months for Lockheed Martin (LMT). Following its last earnings report, the stock has basically gone nuclear. Heading into its July report, the stock was down under $475. From there, the rally has now taken things over $600 to the $605.86 level it closed at today. In the after-hours session, the stock continues to be bid.\n\nNews keeps dropping left and right about government contracts the company has secured. $422 million for integrating the Czech Republic into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, $3.23 billion for air-to-surface standoff missiles, $358 million added to a now $1.1 billion Foreign Military Sales missile procurement, $3.9 billion for Trident II D5 missile production and $321 million for a US Missile Defense contract from the DoD. That wasn\u2019t a year full of announcements, it was all in the last 4 trading days.\n\nMoving Averages: Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.\n\nSupport and Resistance Levels: Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.\n\nChart Patterns: He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.\n\nVolume Analysis: He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.\n\nDave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Lockheed Martin\u2019s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Top Analyst Reports for NextEra Energy, Lockheed Martin &amp; Palo Alto Networks",
        "content": "Wednesday, October 2, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW), as well as two micro-cap stocks Rave Restaurant Group, Inc. (RAVE) and AXIL Brands, Inc. (AXIL). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNextEra Energy\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (+66.5% vs. +39.4%). The company continues to expand its operations through organic projects and acquisitions. NextEra Energy will add more renewable projects to its portfolio and has nearly 22.6 GW of renewable projects in its backlog. \r\n\r\nEfficient cost management is boosting the company's margins. Florida\u2019s improving economy boosts the company\u2019s subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company\u2019s customer base. NextEra Energy has ample liquidity to meet its short-term debt obligations. \r\n\r\nYet, due to the nature of NextEra Energy\u2019s business, it is subject to complex rules and regulations. Risks in operating nuclear power-based generation units, unfavorable weather conditions, and increasing supply costs can adversely impact earnings.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NextEra Energy here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+54.1% vs. +19.9%). The company\u2019s broad product offerings allow it to secure major defense contracts, which in turn boosts its backlog count. Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. \r\n\r\nThe solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Its products also witness a strong international demand from the countries like Germany, Taiwan, Japan and Australia. Meanwhile, the company also holds a strong solvency position. \r\n\r\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact the company\u2019s operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks\u2019 shares have gained +42.2% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Software industry\u2019s gain of +45.9%. The company has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security. \r\n\r\nPANW\u2019s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments. \r\n\r\nHowever, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Palo Alto Networks here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Rave Restaurant\u2019s have gained +5.9% over the past year against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry\u2019s gain of +21.7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $32.38 million continues to demonstrate strong financial performance, posting its 17th consecutive quarter of positive earnings. Fiscal 2024 net income rose 53.3% to $2.5 million. \r\n\r\nRave Restaurant\u2019s debt-free balance sheet with $7.8 million in cash reflects financial stability. Its expansion efforts are focused on the Pizza Inn brand, with reimaging initiatives underway for 25% of its buffet restaurants by fiscal 2025 and 21 new domestic sites contracted. \r\n\r\nDespite growth, challenges persist, including declining same-store sales, particularly in the Pie Five brand (which declined 10.6% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2024), rising operating costs and limited unit expansion. Rave Restaurant\u2019s reliance on franchisees, shrinking international presence, modest revenue growth, and geographic concentration further pose risks to sustained growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Rave Restaurant here >>>)\r\n\r\nAXIL Brands\u2019 shares have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry over the past year (-65.1% vs. +14.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $27.17 million is facing risks which include high reliance on Shopify and Amazon (91% of revenues), rising operating expenses, vendor dependence and limited product diversification (95% of revenues from hearing products). Also, dilution risks from stock issuances and geopolitical factors may impact AXIL's performance.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, AXIL presents a compelling growth opportunity through its expanding market reach across the United States, Canada, the EU and Asia. Partnerships with companies, such as Racing Electronics and Kinsey\u2019s, enhance brand visibility and market penetration, positioning AXIL for revenue growth. \r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s focus on innovation in hearing protection and enhancement products, along with its premium Reviv3 Procare hair and skincare line, ensures alignment with evolving consumer demands. AXIL\u2019s revenues grew 17% year over year in fiscal 2024, driven by its hearing products, while maintaining a strong gross margin of 73.4%.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AXIL Brands here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE), Trane Technologies plc (TT) and Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "Investors interested in stocks from the Aerospace - Defense sector have probably already heard of Leidos (LDOS) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nRight now, both Leidos and Lockheed Martin are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\n\nLDOS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.44, while LMT has a forward P/E of 22.87. We also note that LDOS has a PEG ratio of 1.47. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. LMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.89.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for LDOS is its P/B ratio of 4.93. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, LMT has a P/B of 23.39.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, LDOS holds a Value grade of B, while LMT has a Value grade of C.\n\nBoth LDOS and LMT are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that LDOS is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As a result, it continues to secure a steady flow of orders for its advanced C4ISR capabilities from the Pentagon and U.S. allies, with the latest contract win being a prime example.\r\n\r\nNOC\u2019s E-2D Advanced Hawkeye tactical airborne early warning aircraft serves as a game changer in the U.S. Navy's airborne battle command and control management. It helps manage and protect carrier battle groups, providing warfighters with enhanced battlefield awareness, particularly in air and missile defense, by integrating data from multiple sensors. With its advanced radar and network capabilities, the E-2D Hawkeye delivers critical information rapidly, thereby enabling faster decision-making and improving situational awareness during missions.\r\n\r\nThe C4ISR upgrades, mentioned in the latest contract win, will provide the U.S. armed forces with enhanced information about battle command and control management, thereby boosting their mission readiness.\n\nNOC\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nRising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes have driven nations across the globe to focus more on national security, particularly in strengthening C4ISR capabilities, backed by the growing demand for advanced technologies like network-based battle control, unmanned vehicles and advanced sensor technologies as well as the rising complexity of warfares.\r\n\r\nThis is likely to have prompted Mordor Intelligence to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 3.2% for the global C4ISR market during the 2024-2029 time period.\r\n\r\nThis should benefit Northrop Grumman, a prominent forerunner in C4ISR technologies and supporter of military operations worldwide. The company has been delivering end-to-end communications and advanced networking capabilities for the United States and allied military forces operating across multiple battlespace domains for the past 60 years. In this context, it is worth mentioning NOC\u2019s autonomous high-altitude, long-endurance systems, which offer unrivaled situational awareness over land and maritime domains.\n\nStory continues\n\nProspects of NOC\u2019s Peers\n\nOther defense companies that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding C4ISR market have been discussed below.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin Corporation LMT: The company provides advanced systems for surveillance, reconnaissance and battle management. One of its key programs includes the Command Control Battle Management Communications, which is the first battle management system capable of integrating across domains.\r\n \r\nThe company\u2019s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 4.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 5.3%.\r\n\r\nRTX Corporation RTX: The company focuses on providing integrated defense systems and radar and missile warning systems that improve situational awareness and threat detection. Its Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance systems and multi-mission sensors are critical to both U.S. and international defense operations.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 10.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 7%.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation GD: The company offers advanced communication systems, command and control solutions and ISR platforms that support military forces worldwide. Notably, its subsidiary in Canada offers the Land C4ISR system to the nation\u2019s armed forces to coordinate and conduct modern operations.\r\n \r\nThe company\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 12.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GD\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 13.5%.\n\nNOC Stock\u2019s Price Movement\n\nShares of NOC have gained 24.9% in the past three months compared with the industry\u2019s 13.3% growth.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares soared 3.6% in the last trading session to close at $605.86. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 2.9% gain over the past four weeks.\n\nStocks of major defense contractors, which provide their defense products as a part of America\u2019s military aid to Israel, surged following Iran\u2019s latest missile attack on Israel. Lockheed being the largest defense contractor in the United States, thus witnessed a solid boost in its share price, in the last trading session.\n\nThis aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.5%. Revenues are expected to be $17.45 billion, up 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWhile earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Lockheed, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on LMT going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "title": "Calculating The Fair Value Of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Lockheed Martin fair value estimate is US$752 With US$606 share price, Lockheed Martin appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Our fair value estimate is 35% higher than Lockheed Martin's analyst price target of US$558\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nThe Model\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$6.31b US$6.73b US$7.07b US$7.13b US$7.21b US$7.33b US$7.47b US$7.62b US$7.79b US$7.97b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x8 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 1.24% Est @ 1.62% Est @ 1.88% Est @ 2.07% Est @ 2.20% Est @ 2.29% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1%  US$5.9k US$6.0k US$5.9k US$5.6k US$5.4k US$5.1k US$4.9k US$4.8k US$4.6k US$4.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$53b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$8.0b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (6.1%\u2013 2.5%) = US$228b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$228b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$127b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$179b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$606, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.868. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace & Defense market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.
