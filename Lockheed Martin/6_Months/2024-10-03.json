        "content": "Lockheed Martin's Greatest Upside Potential Is In Space: Analyst Sees Dividend Hikes, Buyback Top Ups\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Scott Deuschle maintains Lockheed MartinCorporation (NYSE:LMT) with a Buy, raising the price forecast from\u00a0$600\u00a0to\u00a0$620.\n\nThe analyst suggests that Lockheed Martin likely prefunds its pension in the fourth quarter, although the company may delay a formal announcement until after it\u2019s completed.\n\nDeuschle adds that the associated debt issuance for this funding is expected to occur sooner.\n\nThe analyst forecasts third-quarter EPS of $6.70, approximately 4% above the Street\u2019s estimate of $6.47.\n\nDeuschle sees revenue of around $17.4 billion, which is $100 million below the Street\u2019s expectation, as the analyst incorporates the $500 million F-35 contract delay impact at Aeronautics, which is not fully reflected in the Street\u2019s projections.\n\nThe analyst identifies the greatest upside potential in Space, noting that underlying margins excluding United Launch Alliance (ULA)\u00a0are expected to decline significantly in the second half.\n\nAlso Read: Lockheed Martin\u2019s Unit Secures Contract for CH-53K Gearbox Assemblies\n\nThis outlook seems conservative, considering that two major contracts\u2014Orion and OPIR\u2014are entering a highly mature phase of their production lifecycle.\n\nThe analyst projects a third-quarter revenue beat, which may lead to an upward revision of the full-year revenue guidance, potentially nearing $72 billion.\n\nDeuschle also sees a 1%-2% increase to the midpoint of the full-year segment EBIT guidance, especially if EBIT upside is realized in Space during the third quarter, as seen in the first half.\n\nThe analyst sees the company offer some indication for 2025 financial trends.\n\nGiven the firm\u2019s conservative track record, the analyst sees the company is likely to project approximately 3% revenue growth and reiterates its target for 10-20 basis points of margin expansion.\n\nDeuschle also projects a dividend increase announcement ahead of earnings, and the buyback authorization will likely be topped up.\n\nPrice Action: LMT shares are trading lower by 0.29% to $601.79 at last check Thursday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nRead Next:\n\nHow Many EVs Has Tesla Delivered, Produced Each Quarter?

        "title": "Boeing Wins a $251M Contract for KC-135 Refueling Tanker Aircraft",
        "content": "The Boeing Company BA recently secured a modification contract worth $251.4 million for the production of fan duct transactional spares for KC-135 aerial refueling tanker aircraft. The award has been offered by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Tinker Air Force Base, OK.\n\nSignificance of BA\u2019s KC-135\n\nBoeing\u2019s KC-135 Stratotanker is an aerial refueling aircraft that provides core aerial refueling capability for the U.S. Air Force and has excelled in this role for more than 60 years.\n\nThe KC-135 is also capable of transporting litter and ambulatory patients using patient support pallets during aeromedical evacuations. Over the years, this aircraft has been altered to perform a variety of operations ranging from flying command post missions to reconnaissance.\n\nBA\u2019s Place in Military Aviation Market\n\nApart from holding a lion's share of the commercial aviation industry along with Airbus, Boeing is a renowned manufacturer of combat aircraft. Its Defense, Space & Security business segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft as well as commercial derivative aircraft, including anti-submarine and tanker aircraft.\n\nSome of its renowned combat-proven jets are the C-17 Globemaster III, F/A-18 Super Hornet, EA-18G Growler, P-8 and F-15EX. The dominant position that Boeing enjoys in the aerial defense space, particularly in the United States, can be gauged from the fact that it has always been the primary aircraft supplier for the nation\u2019s Air Force One program. Impressively, once Boeing 747-8 takes flight as the next Air Force One, its airplanes will mark more than half a century of U.S. presidential service.\n\nGrowth Prospects for BA Stock\n\nIn recent times, rapidly increasing hostilities worldwide, especially the unrest witnessed in different parts of the Middles East, along with the rising complexity of warfare as well as technological advancements in arms and ammunition, have prompted nations across the globe to significantly boost their defense structure in the form of increased investments in military products. Since aerial security plays a critical role in defending a nation\u2019s border from unprecedented attacks, demand for state-of-the-art, agile, combat-proven aircraft has been on the rise.\n\nAs modern military strategies emphasize rapid deployment, long-range strike capabilities and sustained air patrols, advanced refueling support offered by multi-role refueling tanker jets like KC-135 remains the need of the hour. The latest contract win by Boeing is a bright example of that.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm predicts that the global military aviation market will witness a CAGR of 5.2% in the 2024-2029 period. These projections indicate significant growth opportunities for leading combat jet manufacturers like Boeing.\n\nNotably, Boeing\u2019s Defense, Space & Security business segment ended the second quarter of 2024 with a backlog count of $59.06 billion, which reflects solid revenue generation prospects for this unit in the near future.\n\nOpportunities for BA\u2019s Peers\n\nOther aerospace companies that are likely to reap the benefits of the expanding global military aviation market are as follows:\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corp. NOC: The company is a leading provider of manned and unmanned combat aircraft.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT business segment, Space Systems, recently clinched a modification contract for manufacturing its Trident II D5 missile. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will also offer deployed systems support and Warhead 93/Mark7 development for Trident II D5 missile.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $2.11 billion, the contract is projected to be completed by Sept. 30, 2029. The award has been provided by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C.\n\nA major portion of work related to this deal will be carried out in Denver, CO, Valley Forge, PA, Titusville, FL and Magna, UT.\n\nLMT Stock\u2019s Place in Missile Market\n\nLockheed is a well-known manufacturer of missiles and missile defense systems in the global defense industry.

The fact that this program is the only submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile currently in production in the United States surely highlights its significance in the country\u2019s naval defense and the solid demand the company enjoys in the missile marketplace. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\n\nWith such unique featured missile products in its portfolio, Lockheed frequently enjoys a solid order flow for the company\u2019s missiles from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies. This boosts the top-line growth for its MFC and Space Systems unit. Evidently, LMT\u2019s MFC unit registered 12.6% year-over-year growth in its sales in the last reported quarter, while Space Systems witnessed a 1% top-line rise.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for LMT Stock?\n\nIn the past decade, nations across the globe have significantly increased their spending on military equipment and weaponry to modernize and upgrade their defense systems in the face of rapidly rising geopolitical tensions and cross-border disputes worldwide. Amid this backdrop, the demand for missiles has also gained substantial momentum as these play a very important role in military missions.\n\nThis must have prompted the Morder Intelligence firm to predict that the global missile and missile defense systems market will witness a CAGR of 5% in the 2024-2029 period. Such solid market expansion projections exemplify immense growth opportunities for Lockheed.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, the company\u2019s Space Systems unit\u2019s major programs include the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, which provides the U.S. Space Force with enhanced worldwide missile warning capabilities, apart from the Trident II missile. Moreover, its NGI program utilizes next-generation propulsion and sensors to provide homeland missile defense.\n\nGrowth Opportunities for LMT\u2019s Peers\n\nApart from LMT, other prominent defense majors that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding global missile and missile defense market are mentioned below:\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It manufactures notable strike missiles like the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile Extended Range (AARGM-ER), which is a supersonic, air-launched tactical missile system.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NextEra Energy, Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp. and Palo Alto Networks, Inc., as well as two micro-cap stocks Rave Restaurant Group, Inc. and AXIL Brands, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNextEra Energy\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (+66.5% vs. +39.4%). The company continues to expand its operations through organic projects and acquisitions. NextEra Energy will add more renewable projects to its portfolio and has nearly 22.6 GW of renewable projects in its backlog.\r\n\r\nEfficient cost management is boosting the company's margins. Florida\u2019s improving economy boosts the company\u2019s subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company\u2019s customer base. NextEra Energy has ample liquidity to meet its short-term debt obligations.\r\n\r\nYet, due to the nature of NextEra Energy\u2019s business, it is subject to complex rules and regulations.

Meanwhile, the company also holds a strong solvency position.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact the company\u2019s operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks\u2019 shares have gained +42.2% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Software industry\u2019s gain of +45.9%. The company has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security.\r\n\r\nPANW\u2019s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments.\r\n\r\nHowever, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Palo Alto Networks here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Rave Restaurant\u2019s have gained +5.9% over the past year against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry\u2019s gain of +21.7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $32.38 million continues to demonstrate strong financial performance, posting its 17th consecutive quarter of positive earnings. Fiscal 2024 net income rose 53.3% to $2.5 million.\r\n\r\nRave Restaurant\u2019s debt-free balance sheet with $7.8 million in cash reflects financial stability. Its expansion efforts are focused on the Pizza Inn brand, with reimaging initiatives underway for 25% of its buffet restaurants by fiscal 2025 and 21 new domestic sites contracted.\r\n\r\nDespite growth, challenges persist, including declining same-store sales, particularly in the Pie Five brand (which declined 10.6% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2024), rising operating costs and limited unit expansion. Rave Restaurant\u2019s reliance on franchisees, shrinking international presence, modest revenue growth, and geographic concentration further pose risks to sustained growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Rave Restaurant here >>>)\r\n\r\nAXIL Brands\u2019 shares have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry over the past year (-65.1% vs. +14.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $27.17 million is facing risks which include high reliance on Shopify and Amazon (91% of revenues), rising operating expenses, vendor dependence and limited product diversification (95% of revenues from hearing products). Also, dilution risks from stock issuances and geopolitical factors may impact AXIL's performance.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, AXIL presents a compelling growth opportunity through its expanding market reach across the United States, Canada, the EU and Asia. Partnerships with companies, such as Racing Electronics and Kinsey\u2019s, enhance brand visibility and market penetration, positioning AXIL for revenue growth.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s focus on innovation in hearing protection and enhancement products, along with its premium Reviv3 Procare hair and skincare line, ensures alignment with evolving consumer demands. AXIL\u2019s revenues grew 17% year over year in fiscal 2024, driven by its hearing products, while maintaining a strong gross margin of 73.4%.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AXIL Brands here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights United States Oil, Lockheed Martin, Tesla, Freeport McMoran and Netflix",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 October 3, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: United States Oil Fund USO, Lockheed Martin LMT, Tesla TSLA, Freeport McMoran FCX and Netflix NFLX.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nMiddle East Tensions Rise: Correction Ahead?\n\nGeopolitical Tensions Rise as Earnings Season Approaches\n\nStocks swooned Thursday after reports circulated that Iran fired hundreds of rockets into Israel in an apparent escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. Crude oil, which had been down-trending, got a firm bid and was up more than 2% on massive volume. Meanwhile, investors flocked to the United States Oil Fund and defensive stocks such as Lockheed Martin. Following Iran\u2019s aggression, the IDF pre-announced that they would retaliate and potentially target Iran\u2019s crude oil infrastructure.\n\nEarnings Season Approaches\n\n\u201cEarning\u2019s season\u201d usually occurs two weeks after the end of the quarter and refers to when most companies in the major U.S. indices like the S&P 500 Index report earnings. Over the next few weeks, leading stocks such as Tesla, Freeport McMoran and Netflix will report earnings. Often, strong stocks such as these will rally into earnings. However, investors likely have some concerns over the escalating conflicts worldwide. Are investors being too emotional, or should they panic?\n\n\u201cBuy Bombs\u201d\n\n\u201cBuy Bombs\u201d is an old Wall Street saying that illustrates the contrarian nature of markets. Though geopolitical events like 9/11 have caused broad market selloffs, in most instances, stocks sell off in anticipation of the events, and then, when the event finally occurs, stocks rally amid rampant fear. Markets are notoriously manipulative, and though every world citizen should be concerned and market participants should watch for further escalations, geopolitical events are often buyable dips, especially in bull markets (like the one we\u2019re in now).\n\nMarket Internals Tell the Story\n\nSavvy investors understand the importance of looking under the hood and beyond the market indices themselves. Late Thursday, the cumulative tick indicator (a technical analysis indicator that assesses overall buying or selling pressure) flipped positive, and down volume was muted (especially considering how weak the major indices were).\n\nIn other words, thus far, the market is more robust than it looks. Though the conflict could escalate further, savvy investors understand the benefits of interpreting the action rather than predicting the future.\n\nWill October Bring Tax Selling?\n\nTax loss harvesting is a procedure implemented by retail and institutional investors to decrease their taxable income by selling investments they are underwater in towards year-end. Often, institutional investors, who comprise the bulk of trading volume, give themselves a buffer and sell their losers in October.\n\nHowever, thus far, in 2024, U.S. equities are off to one of the best starts in history. Though October can sometimes spell danger like it did in 2023, the S&P 500 Index produced gains of ~8% in 2023 and ~7% in 2021. While some volatility is possible, investors should be open various outcomes in October.\n\nOctober Seasonality\n\nRegarding seasonality, historical data suggests that analysis of the month of October requires investors to exercise some nuance. October is historically a positive month. That said, during presidential election years (like the one we\u2019re in now), October is down -0.8% on average as investors show skittishness amidst uncertainty.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWith geopolitical tensions rising and tax selling season in full swing, some October volatility is possible. However, the historical reactions to geopolitics and bullish market internals suggest it is too early for investors to panic.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.
