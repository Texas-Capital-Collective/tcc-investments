        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently clinched a modification contract for providing Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) requirements. The award has been offered by Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\n\nValued at $221.2 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Apr 30, 2028. The work related to this deal will be executed in Grand Prairie, New Boston, TX and Camden, AK.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nNations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. Spending on missile capabilities has increased, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like Lockheed Martin, which enjoy a dominant position in the development of missiles.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that LMT\u2019s MLRS Family of Munitions includes a variety of precision-strike rockets and missiles, with ongoing evolutionary development to meet the needs of today\u2019s warfighter. These are fired from both the MLRS M270 family of launchers and the HIMARS launchers.\n\nSuch remarkable features of the MLRS are likely to have boosted its demand significantly and, in turn, led to solid contract flows for Lockheed.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility prevalent in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks.\n\nThis should bode well for the missile industry, as evident from the Mordor Intelligence firm\u2019s report, which estimates\u00a0 the missile and missile defense systems market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nLMT\u2019s proficiency in missile manufacturing positions it favorably to capitalize on such market growth opportunities. Notably, Lockheed\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control unit provides combat-proven air and missile defense systems as well as tactical missiles, apart from MLRS. These include Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, Long Range Anti-Ship Missile and a few more missile programs.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nLMT apart, other prominent defense contractors that stand to benefit from the expanding missile and missile defense systems market are as follows:\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics GD: General Dynamics\u2019 Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It also produces composite rocket motor cases and launch tubes for tactical and strategic missiles.\n\nGD has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics\u2019 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 10.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nRTX Corp. RTX: RTX\u2019s business unit, Missiles and Defense, is a prominent U.S. missile maker. Its portfolio includes the AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, the AIM-9X Block II missile, RAM-guided missile weapon system.\n\nRTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of Lockheed Martin have risen 1.6% against the industry\u2019s 8.8% decline.

        "title": "Northrop (NOC) Rewards Shareholders With 10% Hike in Dividend",
        "content": "Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC recently announced that its board of directors approved a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to $2.06 per share, marking the 21st consecutive annual dividend hike. The revised quarterly dividend is payable on Jun 10, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 28.\r\n\r\nFollowing the recent hike, Northrop will now pay out an annual dividend of $8.24 per share. This represents an annual dividend yield of 1.75% based on its share price worth $470.69 as of May 15.\r\n\r\nNOC\u2019s annualized dividend yield is higher than the Zacks S&P 500 composite\u2019s yield of 1.27%. This signifies Northrop\u2019s strength in the business to generate enough cash flow to reward shareholders with improved dividend payouts.\n\nCan Northrop Grumman Sustain Dividend Hikes?\n\nNorthrop Grumman has been consistently boosting its shareholder returns, as is evident by its dividend payout worth $1,052 million and $1,116 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Such a solid distribution strategy is generally buoyed by the steady performance of a company in generating sales and stable cash flows from operations.\r\n\r\nNotably, NOC recorded an 8.9% year-over-year increase in its sales in the last reported quarter. Its cash and cash equivalents came in at $3.06 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024, which improved 22.7% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s tally. Such solid cash balance and sales performances are likely to have enabled Northrop to enhance its dividend.\r\n\r\nAlong with dividend payments, NOC\u2019s management continues to increase shareholder value by repurchasing shares. In the first quarter of 2024, the company repurchased shares worth $1.19 billion, compared to $0.72 billion repurchased in the first quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative to mention in this context that Northrop Grumman\u2019s business strength lies in the orders that it receives as one of the prime defense contractors, which converts into a robust backlog. Notably, the company exited first-quarter 2024 with a record backlog of $78.9 billion, backed by increasing demand and a rising global defense budget. This, in turn, shall boost NOC\u2019s sales growth and cash flow in the coming quarters.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, Northrop Grumman expects to generate sales in the band of $40.80-$41.20 billion for 2024, suggesting an increase of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure. The upside in sales should allow the company to fund notable dividend hikes in the days ahead.\n\nPeer Moves\n\nHere are some Defense companies that have been rewarding shareholders with impressive dividend payouts.\r\n\r\nIn October 2023, Lockheed Martin LMT approved a hike in its quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share, indicating an increase of 5% from the prior payout. This marks the company's 21st consecutive year of raising its dividends.\r\n\r\nLMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.2%. Shares of Lockheed have appreciated 4.3% in the past year.\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 2024, Curtiss-Wright CW announced that its board of directors had declared a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend to 21 cents per share. Moreover, the company authorized an additional $300 million for future share repurchases, increasing the total available authorization to $400 million.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Curtiss-Wright\u2019s 2024 sales suggests growth rate of 6.1% from the prior-year reported figure. CW\u2019s shares have rallied 67.8% in the past year.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, 2024, RTX Technologies RTX announced a dividend of 63 cents per, calling for an increase of 6.8% over the prior quarter's dividend amount. The dividend will be payable on Jun 13, 2024, to its shareholders.\r\n\r\nRTX has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%. Shares of Raytheon have increased 1.6% in the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past three months, shares of Northrop Grumman have risen 4.4% compared with its industry\u2018s decline of 0.6%.

        "content": "Curtiss-Wright Corporation CW announced that its board of directors approved a hike in its quarterly dividend to 21 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 5% from the prior payout. With the current hike, Curtiss-Wright will now pay out an annual dividend of 84 cents per share.\r\n\r\nThis signifies Curtiss-Wright\u2019s strength in the business to generate enough cash flow to reward shareholders with improved dividend payouts.\n\nCurtiss-Wright Enhances Shareholders Value\n\nCurtiss-Wright\u2019s emphasis on returning cash to shareholders is backed by a disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy and is buoyed by its ability to deploy capital effectively. Curtiss-Wright has been returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend hikes, thus highlighting consistency in sharing profits with its shareholders.\r\n\r\nAlong with dividend payments, Curtiss-Wright\u2019s management continues to increase shareholders\u2019 value by repurchasing shares. In the first three months of 2024, the company repurchased shares worth $12.2 million. The board of directors authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchases, increasing the total available authorization to $400 million under the repurchase program.\r\n\r\nSuch a stable return strategy is backed by its ability to generate strong revenues and free cash flows. Curtiss-Wright expects a surge of 5-7% in total sales and projects 8% to 11% growth in earnings in 2024. The company anticipates the free cash flow to increase in the range of 0-5% in 2024.\r\n\r\nAll three business segments of Curtiss-Wright are showing strong growth, which is boosting its earnings. Apart from organic growth, the acquisition of WSC Inc will further expand Curtiss-Wright\u2019s commercial nuclear business. It will create more opportunities for Curtiss-Wright to support its long-term financial goal and generate more revenues.\r\n\r\nThe company is committed to expanding its business through organic methods and strategic acquisitions. The improving end market conditions and rising demand for the high-quality products offered by Curtiss-Wright will continue to generate profits, which can be utilized to increase shareholders' value in future periods.\n\nPeer Moves\n\nOther defense companies are also rewarding their investors through dividend payments and hikes at regular intervals.

With the COVID-19 vaccine removed, operational sales growth increased by 8.3% globally and domestically. The market lead is attributed to growth in important brands, adoption of freshly released products, and vital gains in sales in specific therapeutic areas like oncology.\n\nAdditionally, global medical technology sales rose\u00a06.3% to $7.8 billion. Growth was fueled by the electrophysiology and cardiovascular divisions\u2019 strong performance and innovations in products like Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology.

Therefore, completing the Ambrx acquisition led to a strategic purchase of Shockwave Medical, illustrating the ability to grow through acquisitions and expand into high-growth sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center.

Despite changes in various locations,\u00a0Procter & Gamble kept or increased its volume across several product categories. Notably, volume growth in North America has been consistently positive over the previous four quarters, with increases ranging from 2% to 4%.\n\nMoreover, Procter & Gamble is expanding widely in several product sectors.\u00a0Certain\u00a0categories saw slower growth rates, while others \u2014 like oral care, home care, and grooming \u2014 saw double- or triple-digit increases in organic sales.

During the quarter, Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) recorded 125 net orders, with notable orders for the 737-10 and 777X types. The increase in the order book and backlog demonstrates Boeing\u2019s capacity to draw in and keep consumers despite obstacles.\n\nAdditionally, Boeing announced\u00a0$16.6 billion in sales for the quarter despite obstacles, including fewer 737 deliveries and the 737-9 grounding effects. Despite an 8% decrease in sales from the prior year, the company\u2019s resilience in generating significant income in the face of hardship is noteworthy. Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) experienced difficulties with its operational margin during the quarter, as it was negative 24.6%. However, the 737-9 grounding impact and fewer 737 deliveries were the\u00a0leading\u00a0causes.\n\nTo sum up, Boeing Defense & Space (BDS) delivered an operating margin of 2.2%, indicating a sequential increase with potential for improvement. Lastly, 60% of revenue came from the core business, which performed well in the mid-to-high single-digit profit range.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe defense budget for FY2024 benefits Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) by providing considerable money for several projects. The budget allots money for secret operations, hypersonics, and multi-year weapon acquisitions. Global demand for Lockheed Martin\u2019s goods is high, supporting the company\u2019s international expansion.\n\nFor instance, the business\u00a0received orders for F-35 aircraft from Singapore, Greece, and the Czech Republic. Moreover, Turkey may purchase 40 F-16s, demonstrating the company\u2019s global reach. Hence, these purchases strengthen Lockheed Martin\u2019s lead in the international military industry and boost top-line growth and diversity.\n\nSolid measures of the company\u2019s bottom line and financial standing include cash flow from operations, free cash flow, EPS, and segment operating profit. For instance, Lockheed Martin reported\u00a0$1.7 billion in segment operating profit on 10.1% margins. Finally, the company has the fundamental capacity to turn sales into cash efficiently, reflected in the $1.3 billion\u00a0in free cash flow it created during Q1 2024.\n\nValue Stocks to Buy and Hold: AbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie\u2019s (NYSE:ABBV) fundamental capacity to continuously derive solid outcomes is based on its operational edge. The business delivered adjusted EPS of $2.31 for Q1 2024, 11 cents more than anticipated. The first quarter\u2019s total net sales of $12.3 billion beat forecasts by almost $400 million, indicating an operational growth rate of 1.6% again. Moreover, the business\u2019s 42.2% adjusted operating margin ratio shows effective cost control and operational effectiveness, bolstering profitability and future investments.\n\nFurther, strong performance across all therapeutic categories of AbbVie\u2019s primary medicines is a crucial factor in the company\u2019s commercial lead. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have become industry leaders in immunology, securing a sizable portion of the market and exhibiting strong revenue growth rates. The business\u2019s portfolios for neurology and cancer are expanding rapidly as well; drugs like Venclexta, Vraylar, and Botox Therapeutic are dominating their respective markets.\n\nIn short, AbbVie has a solid basis for long-term growth and global expansion because of its unique pharmaceutical offerings and\u00a0market-leading positions in several therapeutic categories.\n\nCVS Health (CVS) A photo of the CVS logo over the door of one of its stores.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn Q1 2024, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) derived $4.9 billion in  operational cash. The timing of Medicare payments is the reason for the weaker results against Q1 2023. However, the company\u2019s sharp cash flow indicates financial stability. Specifically, CVS Health has solid financial health, with around $1.9 billion in cash in Q1 and a focus on sustaining investment-grade ratings.\n\nIndeed, every segment of CVS Health focuses on meeting financial targets and carrying out its objectives in a way that demonstrates operational effectiveness. The Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness division had a roughly\u00a03% rise in revenue,\u00a0primarily\u00a0due to the increase in prescription volume and vaccine contributions. Notwithstanding a roughly 10% decline in sales, the Health Services division saw growth in specialty pharmacy and the purchase of Oak Street Health and Signify Health.\n\nOn the other hand, innovative pharmacy formats and adopting biosimilars through Cordavis are just two examples of strategic initiatives.
