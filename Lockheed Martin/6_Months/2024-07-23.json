        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT reported second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $7.11 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.45 by 10.2%. The bottom line also improved 5.6% from the year-ago quarter's recorded figure of $6.73.\n\nThe company reported GAAP earnings of $6.85 per share compared with $6.63 in the prior-year period.\n\nThe year-over-year bottom-line improvement can be attributed to solid sales growth and operating profit improvement from the second quarter of 2023.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lockheed Martin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lockheed Martin Corporation Quote\n\nOperational Highlights\n\nNet sales were $18.12 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.10 billion by 6%. The top line also increased 8.6% from $16.69 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe year-over-year top-line improvement can be attributed to sales growth from each of the four company segments.\n\nBacklog\n\nLMT\u2019s backlog as of Jun 30, 2024, was $158.34 billion compared with $159.37 billion at the end of first-quarter 2024.\n\nOur model projected a backlog worth $179.34 billion for the second quarter.\n\nThe Aeronautics segment accounted for $53.03 billion of the total backlog amount, while Rotary and Mission Systems contributed $37.36 billion. The Missiles and Fire Control segment contributed $34.83 billion, while the Space unit accounted for $33.11 billion.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nAeronautics: Sales improved 5.8% year over year to $7.28 billion. This was driven by sales growth from a higher volume on sustainment, development and production contracts for F-35 program, and ramped-up production of the F-16 program.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit improved 4.6% year over year to $751 million. The operating margin, however, contracted 10 basis points (bps) to 10.3%.\n\nMissiles and Fire Control: Quarterly sales improved a solid 12.6% year over year to $3.10 billion. This was on account of higher sales from tactical and strike missile programs, driven by a production ramp-up of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (\u201cGMLRS\u201d) and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (\u201cLRASM\u201d) programs.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit increased 21.3% year over year to $450 million. The operating margin of 14.5% expanded 100 bps from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level.\n\nSpace: Sales rose 0.9% year over year to $3.20 billion due to higher sales from strategic and missile defense programs, driven by higher volume of the hypersonics and Fleet Ballistic Missile (\u201cFBM\u201d) programs.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit rose 10.9% to $346 million. The operating margin expanded 90 bps to 10.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nRotary and Mission Systems: Quarterly revenues improved 16.7% to $4.55 billion on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily driven by higher net sales from integrated warfare systems and sensors programs. Higher net sales from Sikorsky helicopter programs also aided this segment\u2019s top line.\n\nThe segment\u2019s operating profit rose 9% to $495 million in the reported quarter. The operating margin, however, deteriorated 70 bps to 10.9% in the said time frame.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nLockheed\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.52 billion at the end of second-quarter 2024 compared with $1.44 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nCash from operating activities amounted to $3.51 billion as of Jun 31, 2024, compared with $2.66 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nLong-term debt as of Jun 30, 2024, totaled $19.12 billion, up from $17.29 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nLockheed has partially raised its financial guidance for 2024. The company now expects to generate revenues in the range of $70.50-$71.50 billion, up from the prior guidance of $68.50-$70.00 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $69.80 billion, which lies below the company\u2019s updated guided range.\n\nLMT currently expects 2024 earnings per share (EPS) to be in the range of $26.10-$26.60, up from the earlier guidance of $25.65-$26.35. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s full-year EPS is pinned at $26.20, lower than the mid-point of the company\u2019s updated guidance.\n\nLockheed still expects to generate free cash flow in the range of $6.00-$6.30 billion and incur capital expenditures of $1.75 billion during 2024.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nLMT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nRecent Defense Releases\n\nHexcel Corporation HXL reported second-quarter 2024 earnings of 60 cents per share, which improved 20% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure of 50 cents.\n\nThe company\u2019s net sales totaled $500.4 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $482 million by 3.8%. The top line also witnessed an improvement of 10.1% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported sales of $454.3 million.\n\nTextron Inc. TXT reported second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $1.54 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 by 3.4%.

The reported figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $660 million by 0.6% but increased 18.7% from $553.3 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) came out with quarterly earnings of $7.11 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.45 per share. This compares to earnings of $6.73 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.23%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this aerospace and defense company would post earnings of $5.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.33, delivering a surprise of 9.14%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nLockheed , which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, posted revenues of $18.12 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.88%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $16.69 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nLockheed shares have added about 4.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 16.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Lockheed?\n\nWhile Lockheed has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Lockheed: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $6.43 on $17.37 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $26.20 on $69.8 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Aerospace - Defense is currently in the top 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, RTX (RTX), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on July 25.\n\nThis an aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nRTX's revenues are expected to be $19.31 billion, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Reports Bullish Q2, Full-Year Sales Guidance Is Optimistic\n\nSecurity and Aerospace company Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) reported Q2 CY2024 results exceeding Wall Street analysts' expectations , with revenue up 8.6% year on year to $18.12 billion. The company's full-year revenue guidance of $71 billion at the midpoint also came in 1.8% above analysts' estimates. It made a non-GAAP profit of $7.11 per share, improving from its profit of $6.73 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Lockheed Martin? Find out in our full research report.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Q2 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $18.12 billion vs analyst estimates of $17.01 billion (6.5% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $7.11 vs analyst estimates of $6.45 (10.3% beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 11.8%, down from 12.5% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $1.51 billion, up 19.8% from the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $113.9 billion\n\n\"Over the past few months, Lockheed Martin's people, systems, and platforms have again demonstrated their ability to enhance security in Eastern Europe, the Red Sea, and the Middle East. From the PAC-3's critical role in air defense, to the Aegis Combat System with AI augmentation, to the F-35 with its advanced sensor and data management capabilities, our company has made major contributions to allied and partner defense. We continue to demonstrate the impact of our 21st Century Security\u00ae strategy by harnessing the latest digital technologies to continuously improve mission effectiveness, strengthening and scaling the defense production system, and expanding industrial cooperation among our allies and partners. Consequently, demand for our defense technology solutions remains robust, with a backlog of nearly $160 billion, greater than two times annual revenue,\" said Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO Jim Taiclet.\n\nHeadquartered in Maryland, Famous for the F-35 aircraft, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) specializes in defense, space, homeland security, and information technology products.\n\nDefense Contractors\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales Growth\n\nExamining a company's long-term performance can provide clues about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Unfortunately, Lockheed Martin's 4.3% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was sluggish. This shows it failed to expand in any major way and is a rough starting point for our analysis. Lockheed Martin Total Revenue\n\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Lockheed Martin's annualized revenue growth of 5.2% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was consistently weak.\n\nThis quarter, Lockheed Martin reported solid year-on-year revenue growth of 8.6%, and its $18.12 billion of revenue outperformed Wall Street's estimates by 6.5%. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability. It\u2019s the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses\u2013everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. Operating margin is also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\n\nLockheed Martin has been an optimally run company over the last five years. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the industrials sector, boasting an average operating margin of 13%.\n\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Lockheed Martin's annual operating margin decreased by 1.5 percentage points over the last five years. Even though its margin is still high, shareholders will want to see Lockheed Martin become more profitable in the future. Lockheed Martin Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nIn Q2, Lockheed Martin generated an operating profit margin of 11.9%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company's overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n\nEPS\n\nAnalyzing long-term revenue trends tells us about a company's historical growth, but the long-term change in its earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth\u2013for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\n\nLockheed Martin's EPS grew at an unimpressive 6.5% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This performance was better than its 4.3% annualized revenue growth but doesn't tell us much about its day-to-day operations because its operating margin didn't expand. Lockheed Martin EPS (Adjusted)\n\nDiving into the nuances of Lockheed Martin's earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. A five-year view shows that Lockheed Martin has repurchased its stock, shrinking its share count by 15.6%. This tells us its EPS outperformed its revenue not because of increased operational efficiency but financial engineering, as buybacks boost per share earnings. Lockheed Martin Diluted Shares Outstanding\n\nLike with revenue, we also analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business. For Lockheed Martin, its two-year annual EPS growth of 11.9% was higher than its five-year trend. This acceleration made it one of the faster-growing industrials companies in recent history.\n\nIn Q2, Lockheed Martin reported EPS at $7.11, up from $6.73 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts' estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Lockheed Martin to perform poorly. Analysts are projecting its EPS of $28.11 in the last year to shrink by 5.3% to $26.61.\n\nKey Takeaways from Lockheed Martin's Q2 Results\n\nWe were impressed by how significantly Lockheed Martin blew past analysts' revenue and EPS expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year revenue guidance came in higher than Wall Street's estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a fantastic quarter that should have shareholders cheering. The stock remained flat at $478 immediately following the results.\n\nLockheed Martin may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

        "content": "By Pratyush Thakur and Mike Stone\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. defense company Lockheed Martin raised its annual sales target for the first time this year on Tuesday, following the unexpected resumption of deliveries of its F-35 aircraft after Pentagon began accepting the jets last week.\n\nThe U.S. resumed taking F-35 deliveries after a months-long pause due to delays on its software upgrade. Lockheed has been upgrading the jets under Technology Refresh 3, or TR-3 program, that gives the F-35 better displays and processing power.\n\nThe delivery resumption includes incomplete software upgrade and Pentagon will withhold some payment, the details of which is unknown, until the remaining enhancements are finished.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLockheed's F-35 is the world's largest defense program and contributes around 30% of the company's revenue.\n\n\"The F-35 remains a top priority, and we recently delivered the first TR-3-configured aircraft to the customer and anticipate deliveries for 2024 to meet our expected range of 75-110 F-35s,\" said CEO Jim Taiclet.\n\nTR-3 involves both hardware and software improvements and is seen as a pillar of a wider upgrade to the stealth jet known as Block 4. The enhancements \"are critical steps in ensuring the F-35 remains the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world and the key air vehicle node in the DoD's joint all domain architecture\", Taiclet said.\n\nLockheed, however, does not expect the full tech refresh package to be ready for months.\n\nIt expects 2024 sales to be between $70.5 billion and $71.5 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $68.5 billion to $70 billion.\n\nThe company also benefited from a $95-billion additional funding, which includes aid for Ukraine and Israel, approved by Congress.\n\nCombat in Ukraine and Israel has consumed high volumes of munitions, including Lockheed-made Patriot air defense interceptors, used to shoot down incoming hostile missiles.\n\nLockheed posted net income of $6.85 per share for the second quarter, compared with $6.63 per share a year earlier.\n\nTotal quarterly sales rose 8.5% to $18.12 billion.\n\n(Reporting by Pratyush Thakur in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)",

It is the company's practice not to incorporate adjustments into its financial outlook for proposed or potential acquisitions, divestitures, ventures, pension risk transfer transactions, financing transactions, changes in law, or new accounting standards until such items have been consummated, enacted or adopted. For additional factors that may impact the company's actual results, refer to the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section in this news release.\n\n(in\u00a0millions, except per share data) Current Update April 2024 Net sales $70,500 - $71,500 $68,500 - $70,000 Business segment operating profit1 $7,350 - $7,500 $7,175 - $7,375 Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment ~$1,685 ~$1,685 Diluted earnings per share2 $26.10 - $26.60 $25.65 - $26.35 Cash from operations $7,750 - $8,050 $7,750 - $8,050 Capital expenditures ~$1,750 ~$1,750 Free cash flow1 $6,000 - $6,300 $6,000 - $6,300 1 Business segment operating profit and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. See the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this news release for more information. 2 Although the company typically does not update its outlook for proposed changes in law, the above includes the effect of IRS Notice 2023-63 confirming that certain expenditures incurred in the performance of cost-type contracts are not subject to capitalization for tax purposes. The company believes incorporating the clarification from the Notice more accurately reflects its expectations because the Notice describes the tax treatment of certain expenditures in accordance with the company's analysis of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nCash Flows and Capital Deployment Activities\n\nThe increase in operating and free cash flows in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to improvements in working capital (defined as receivables, contract assets, and inventories less accounts payable and contract liabilities) and the timing of federal tax payments. Improvements in working capital were driven by volume and timing of milestone payments impacting both contract liabilities and contract assets on classified programs at the company's Space business segment, decreases in inventory due to deliveries of S-70 helicopters at Sikorsky at the company's RMS business segment, and production and billing cycle timing impacting receivables (primarily F-35 at Aeronautics and Integrated Air and Missile Defense at MFC, partially offset by Integrated warfare systems and sensors at RMS). These improvements were partially offset by the timing of cash payments related to accounts payable (primarily Aeronautics).\n\nThe company's cash activities in the second quarter of 2024, included the following:\n\npaying cash dividends of $752 million; paying $850 million to repurchase 1.9 million shares; and making a long-term debt scheduled repayment of $168 million.\n\nSegment Results\n\nThe company operates in four business segments organized based on the nature of products and services offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. The following table presents summary operating results of the company's business segments and reconciles these amounts to the company's consolidated financial results.\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended Six Months Ended June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 Net sales Aeronautics $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7,277 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,875 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 14,122 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13,144 Missiles and Fire Control 3,102 2,755 6,095 5,143 Rotary and Mission Systems 4,548 3,897 8,636 7,407 Space  3,195 3,166 6,464 6,125 Total net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 18,122 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16,693 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 35,317 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 31,819 Operating profit Aeronautics $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 751 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 718 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,430 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,393 Missiles and Fire Control 450 371 761 748 Rotary and Mission Systems  495 454 925 804 Space  346 312 671 592 Total business segment operating\n\nprofit 2,042 1,855 3,787 3,537 Unallocated items FAS/CAS operating adjustment  406 416 812 831 Impairment and severance charges  (87) \u2014 (87) \u2014 Intangible asset amortization\n\nexpense (61) (62) (122) (124) Other, net (152) (74) (213) (72) Total unallocated items 106 280 390 635 Total consolidated operating profit $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,148 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,135 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,177 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,172\n\nFor information on factors impacting comparability of the company's segment sales, operating profit and operating margins, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\u00a0Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nThe company's consolidated net favorable profit booking rate adjustments represented approximately 21% and 20% of total segment operating profit in the quarters ended June\u00a030, 2024 and June\u00a025, 2023. During the quarter ended June 25, 2023, we recognized a favorable profit adjustment of $65 million on an international surveillance and control program due to the positive resolution of a contractual matter, and an unfavorable profit adjustment of $100 million on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program (CMHP) as a result of increased costs and lower than planned revenues.\n\nAeronautics\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended Six Months Ended June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 Net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7,277 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,875 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 14,122 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13,144 Operating profit 751 718 1,430 1,393 Operating margin 10.3\u00a0% 10.4\u00a0% 10.1\u00a0% 10.6\u00a0%\n\nAeronautics' net sales in the second quarter of 2024 increased $402 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $335 million on the F-35 program due to higher volume on\u00a0sustainment, development and production contracts; and $105 million on the F-16 program due to the ramp up on production.\n\nAeronautics' operating profit in the second quarter of 2024 increased $33 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in operating profit was attributable to $35 million from higher volume and program ramp up described above and $25 million from favorable contract mix across the portfolio, partially offset by $25 million of lower profit booking rate adjustments. The decrease in profit booking rate adjustments was due to a $45 million unfavorable profit adjustment on a classified program because of higher than anticipated costs to maintain program objectives, partially offset by higher net favorable profit adjustments across the portfolio.\n\nMissiles and Fire Control\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended Six Months Ended June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 Net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,102 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,755 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,095 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5,143 Operating profit 450 371 761 748 Operating margin 14.5\u00a0% 13.5\u00a0% 12.5\u00a0% 14.5\u00a0%\n\nMFC's net sales in the second quarter of 2024 increased $347 million, or 13%,\u00a0compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $320 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to production ramp up on Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) programs.\n\nMFC's operating profit in the second quarter of 2024 increased $79 million, or 21%, compared to the same period in 2023, due to $80 million of higher profit booking rate adjustments which primarily reflects higher favorable profit booking rate adjustments on PAC-3 and Apache due to better than anticipated cost performance. Additionally, operating profit increased $30 million from production ramp up described above, offset by $30 million decrease from contract mix.\n\nRotary and Mission Systems\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended Six Months Ended June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 Net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4,548 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,897 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8,636 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7,407 Operating profit 495 454 925 804 Operating margin 10.9\u00a0% 11.6\u00a0% 10.7\u00a0% 10.9\u00a0%\n\nRMS' net sales in the second quarter of 2024 increased $651 million, or 17%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $420 million on integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs due to higher volume on radar programs and the Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) program, and new program ramp up within the laser systems portfolio; and $160 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to higher production volume on Black Hawk and CH-53K programs.\n\nRMS' operating profit in the second quarter of 2024 increased $41 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2023.\u00a0The increase in operating profit was attributable to $70 million from higher volume described above, partially offset by $20 million of lower profit booking rate adjustments. The decrease in profit booking rate adjustments was due to unfavorable profit adjustments on Seahawk and Black Hawk production programs as a result of increased costs, partially offset by the net impact in the second quarter of 2023 of both a $65 million favorable profit adjustment on an international surveillance and control program and a $100 million unfavorable profit adjustment on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program (CMHP) that did not recur in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nSpace\n\n(in\u00a0millions) Quarters Ended Six Months Ended June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 Net sales $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,195 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,166 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,464 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,125 Operating profit 346 312 671 592 Operating margin 10.8\u00a0% 9.9\u00a0% 10.4\u00a0% 9.7\u00a0%\n\nSpace's net sales in the second quarter of 2024 increased $29 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $110 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume on the hypersonics and Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) programs; partially offset by lower net sales of $50 million for national security space due to lower volume on classified programs and $45 million for commercial civil space due to lower volume on the Orion program.\n\nSpace's operating profit in the second quarter of 2024 increased $34 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2023.\u00a0The increase in operating profit was attributable to $20 million from favorable contract mix across the portfolio and $20 million of higher profit booking rate adjustments. The increase in profit booking rate adjustments was due to higher favorable profit adjustments on the FBM program.\n\nTotal equity earnings/(losses) (primarily ULA) represented approximately $10 million, or 3% of Space's operating profit in the second quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $20 million, or 6% for the same period in 2023.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe company's effective income tax rate was 15.8% and 16.2% for the quarters ended June\u00a030, 2024 and June\u00a025, 2023. The rates for both periods benefited from research and development tax credits, tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income and dividends paid to the company's\u00a0defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis news release contains the following non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) financial measures (as defined by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation G). While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating the financial performance of the company, this information should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company's definitions for non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies or analysts.\n\nBusiness segment operating profit\n\nBusiness segment operating profit represents operating profit from the company's business segments before unallocated income and expense. This measure is used by the company's senior management in evaluating the performance of its business segments and is a performance goal in the company's annual incentive plan. Business segment operating margin is calculated by dividing business segment operating profit by sales. The table below reconciles the non-GAAP measure business segment operating profit with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, consolidated operating profit.\n\n(in millions) Current Update April 2024 Business segment operating profit (non-GAAP) $7,350 - $7,500 $7,175 - $7,375 FAS/CAS operating adjustment1 ~1,625 ~1,625 Intangible asset amortization expense ~(245) ~(245) Other, net2 ~(530) ~(400) Consolidated operating profit (GAAP) ~$8,200 - 8,350 ~$8,155 - $8,355 1 Reflects the amount by which expected total CAS pension cost of $1.7 billion, exceeds the expected FAS pension service cost and excludes expected non-service FAS pension income. Refer to the supplemental table \"Selected Financial Data\" included in this news release for a detail of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. 2 Includes impairment and severance charges of $87\u00a0million ($69\u00a0million, or $0.29 per share, after-tax) for trademark and fixed asset impairments as well as severance costs recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nFree cash flow\n\nFree cash flow is cash from operations less capital expenditures. The company's capital expenditures are comprised of equipment and facilities infrastructure and information technology (inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized). The company uses free cash flow to evaluate its business performance and overall liquidity and it is a performance goal in the company's annual and long-term incentive plans. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it represents the amount of cash generated from operations after reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchases and debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions or other investments. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, because it does not account for certain mandatory expenditures, such as the repayment of maturing debt and future pension contributions.\n\nAdjusted earnings before income taxes; adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS\n\nEarnings before income taxes, net earnings and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were impacted by certain non-operational items for all periods. Management believes the presentation of these measures adjusted for the impacts of these non-operational items is useful to investors in understanding the company's underlying business performance and comparing performance from period to period. The tax effects related to each adjustment that impacted earnings before income taxes are based on a blended tax rate that combines the federal statutory rate of 21% plus an estimated state tax rate.\n\nThe table below shows the impact to earnings before income taxes, net earnings and diluted EPS for certain non-operational items:\n\n(in\u00a0millions, except per share data) Quarters Ended June 30,\n\n2024 June 25,\n\n2023 Earnings Before\r\nIncome Taxes Net Earnings Diluted EPS Earnings Before\r\nIncome Taxes Net Earnings Diluted EPS As Reported (GAAP) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,948 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,641 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.85 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,006 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,681 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.63 Impairment and severance charges 87 69 0.29 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Mark-to-market investment (gains) losses (8) (6) (0.03) 28 21 0.08 Debt transactions costs \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 6 5 0.02 Total Adjustments 79 63 0.26 34 26 0.10 As Adjusted (Non-GAAP) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,027 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,704 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7.11 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,040 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,707 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.73\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation will webcast live the earnings results conference call (listen-only mode) on Tuesday, July 23, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. ET on the Lockheed Martin Investor Relations website at www.lockheedmartin.com/investor.
