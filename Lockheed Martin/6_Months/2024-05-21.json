        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +1.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.1% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Lockheed belongs, has gained 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.45 per share, indicating a change of -4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.26 points to a change of -5.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.37 indicates a change of +8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Lockheed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $17.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2%. The $69.72 billion and $72.43 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.2% and +3.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $17.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $6.33 for the same period compares with $6.43 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.21%. The EPS surprise was +9.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
