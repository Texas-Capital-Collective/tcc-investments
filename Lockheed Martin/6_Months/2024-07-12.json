        "title": "RTX Secures $1.2B Contract for Patriot Missile Defense Systems",
        "content": "RTX Corporation\u2019s RTX business segment, Raytheon, recently won a $1.2 billion contract for delivering its Patriot air and missile defense systems to Germany. The successful delivery of the aforementioned missile system should improve revenue growth for RTX in the future years.\r\n\r\nPer the terms of the agreement, RTX will offer the most current Patriot Configuration 3+ radars, launchers, command and control stations, associated spares and support to the German government.\n\nSignificance of the Patriot System\n\nPatriot is a long-range, high-altitude, all-weather missile defense system intended to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and sophisticated fighter aircraft. The Patriot system is made up of radars, command-and-control technologies and a variety of interceptors.\r\n\r\nThe robust demand for Patriots in the missile defense sector is demonstrated by the fact that 240 Patriot fire units have been delivered to date and that 19 nations are currently using PATRIOT for their integrated air and missile defense.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring RTX?\n\nIn the wake of the global upsurge in geopolitical tensions, countries have been bolstering their military capabilities on several fronts in recent years. Rapid technical advancements have made missile defense an increasingly important component of a country's military policy. RTX, being a well-known missile manufacturer, has been witnessing a solid flow of orders for its combat-proven missiles, backed by the growing use of missile defense by countries worldwide. The aforementioned contract award is a prime illustration of that.\r\n\r\nOf late, hostile activities like the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing unrest in the Middle East have been bolstering the demand scenario in the missile market even more. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm predicts the global market for missiles and missile defense systems to witness a CAGR of 5% between 2024 and 2029. This should benefit RTX, which has a handful of combat-proven missiles in its product portfolio, like the TOW missile, Guidance Enhanced Missile, the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, Tomahawk, Standard Missile 2 and a few more, in addition to the Patriot missile.\n\nPeer Prospects\n\nAs global threats rise, apart from RTX, military contractors that are projected to gain from the growth prospects presented by the missiles and missile defense system industry are as follows:\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It creates and manufactures warheads, fuses, sophisticated high-speed propulsion systems and other missile components. The company is one of the top suppliers of solid rocket propulsion for air-launched missiles, interceptors, submarine-launched weapons and hypersonic missile systems.\r\n\r\nNorthrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales suggests growth of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin LMT: Its Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat, missile, rocket, manned and unmanned systems for military customers. Some of its renowned products are the PAC-3 family of missiles, M270, RRPR, THHAD and a few more.\r\n\r\nLockheed has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT\u2019s 2024 sales implies growth of 3.2% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics GD: Its Mission Systems unit has designed, produced, installed and sustained every version of the Weapon Control System (Fire Control) for Polaris, Poseidon, Trident I and Trident II Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles. The company has been recently selected to perform the intercontinental ballistic missile Concept Design and Architecture-Guidance study.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics\u2019 long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 12%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GD\u2019s 2024 sales calls for growth of 10.5% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past six months, shares of RTX Corp. have risen 17.8% against the industry\u2019s decline of 6.8%.

        "title": "These 2 Aerospace Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar",
        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Lockheed Martin (LMT) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $6.60 a share 11 days away from its upcoming earnings release on July 23, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $6.60 Most Accurate Estimate and the $6.44 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of 2.59%.\n\nLMT is part of a big group of Aerospace stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Northrop Grumman (NOC) as well.\n\nNorthrop Grumman, which is readying to report earnings on July 25, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $6.03 a share, and NOC is 13 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop Grumman is $5.98, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.86%.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, LMT and NOC could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.
