        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Lockheed Martin is US$649 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$469 suggests Lockheed Martin is potentially 28% undervalued The US$487 analyst price target for LMT is 25% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nThe Model\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$6.22b US$6.16b US$6.41b US$7.09b US$7.16b US$7.25b US$7.37b US$7.51b US$7.66b US$7.82b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x10 Analyst x6 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Est @ 1.34% Est @ 1.65% Est @ 1.87% Est @ 2.02% Est @ 2.13% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4%  US$5.8k US$5.4k US$5.3k US$5.5k US$5.2k US$5.0k US$4.8k US$4.6k US$4.4k US$4.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$50b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$7.8b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (6.4%\u2013 2.4%) = US$197b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$197b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$106b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$156b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$469, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.883. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Aerospace & Defense industry.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace & Defense market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?
