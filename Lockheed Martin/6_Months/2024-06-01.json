        "content": "It may seem that Cupertino-based giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has fallen behind its Big Tech peers in the race for AI, as the company has only achieved a modest performance of just 3% this year compared to the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d group of leading technology companies. However, several reasons justify my bullish stance on Apple. In this article, I\u2019ll outline three of them: Apple\u2019s advancements in AI, the potential growth in China, and the company\u2019s robust fundamentals and strategic share buybacks.\n\nAI Is Finally Playing Its Game on AAPL\n\nSince last year, Apple has made some moves to catch up with its peers, but it\u00a0is\u00a0still\u00a0far from leading\u00a0the pack.\u00a0This\u00a0has sent a bearish wave through the stock, causing the Cupertino company\u2019s share price to\u00a0be stuck\u00a0in second gear.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that Apple isn\u2019t making any progress on AI. The Cupertino-based company has been on a shopping spree, acquiring 32 AI start-ups in 2023\u2014more than any other tech giant, which indicates the company\u2019s efforts to expand its AI capabilities. However, as the old saying goes, \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day,\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0it seems the market is ignoring this fact, as other tech companies appear to be more advanced with their AI developments.\n\nI believe part of the market\u2019s skepticism towards Apple and its early AI efforts has\u00a0been influenced\u00a0by the launch of the VisionPro, the \u201cmagic\u201d virtual reality glasses powered by AI and machine learning. The VisionPro has received mixed reviews, with some users calling it a dud and others praising its immersive experiences. The steep $3,500 price tag hasn\u2019t helped its case,\u00a0either, making it a tough sell for the average consumer.\n\nAdditionally, Apple has faced challenges in production and demand forecasts, with reports of slashed production numbers and fading hype.\n\nIn reality, VisionPro was just Apple\u2019s first step into AI. But Apple has also been working on its\u00a0own\u00a0large language models (LLMs) and has even developed a chatbot, although it has yet to define how it will unveil it to the general public. A significant step will\u00a0be taken\u00a0when this model\u00a0is integrated\u00a0into the hardware. This integration\u00a0is expected\u00a0to begin with the launch of the AI App Store in June during its prestigious WWDC developers\u2019 conference.\n\nEventually, Apple will integrate AI and LLMs into its hardware.\u00a0There is also great anticipation\u00a0regarding Siri\u2019s on-device AI capabilities, such as real-time analysis using the iOS 18 camera.\n\nIn short, when AI\u00a0is integrated\u00a0into Apple\u2019s massive user base of two billion active iPhones, not counting other iOS devices,\u00a0it\u2019s very likely that\u00a0Apple will\u00a0be taken\u00a0more seriously regarding its AI capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina May be Shifting from a Headwind to a\u00a0Tailwind\n\niPhone demand in China has been a black eye for Apple\u00a0throughout\u00a0this year. The iPhone, Apple\u2019s core segment and accounting for 54% of its revenues, has exposed the company\u2019s over-dependence on a single line of business.\n\nChina is a crucial market for Apple, but local competition, especially from Huawei, has been gaining ground. A report earlier this year highlighted that Huawei has been eating into Apple\u2019s market share, leading to a 19.1% drop in iPhone sales in China during Q1. Meanwhile, Huawei\u2019s sales surged by 69.7%, driven by a significant upgrade in its new smartphone model after months of struggling to secure parts due to Western sanctions.\n\nHowever, what currently looks like a black eye could soon turn into a silver lining. Wedbush\u2019s perma-bull analyst Dan Ives suggests that while current economic data in China doesn\u2019t indicate a turnaround, a rise in upgrades could shift the narrative.\u00a0There are 225 million iPhones in China, and 70%\u00a0of these\u00a0haven\u2019t\u00a0been\u00a0upgraded\u00a0in the last three years.\u00a0Ives\u2019 theory is that many of these consumers are moving to Pro models, which boosts the average selling price (ASP) of iPhones in China.\n\nRobust Fundamentals and Share Buybacks\n\nIn addition to the two reasons mentioned above, I believe Apple\u2019s extraordinarily robust fundamentals round out the case for why Apple stock may still have significant upside potential and recover from its lackluster performance so far this year.\n\nFirst off, Apple\u2019s fundamentals remain rock solid. Even though market fears have dampened hardware demand amid unimpressive economic growth, Apple is far from a struggling company. Services have been a\u00a0major\u00a0bright spot.\n\nTake its most recent quarter, for example. Despite iPhone sales dropping 12% year-over-year and product revenues falling 10% year-over-year, services revenue jumped 14.2% year-over-year, hitting an all-time high. This growth in services helped minimize the overall 4.3% drop in net sales, allowing Apple to beat market estimates in both EPS and revenues.\n\nIn my view, since Apple operates across two main segments\u2014products and services\u2014the latter is where the company\u2019s valuation could see the most growth, especially with the potential AI adoption cycle. The high scalability of the App Store and Apple TV+ further supports this potential.\n\nMoreover, Apple\u00a0has generated\u00a0a\u00a0massive\u00a0amount of\u00a0cash\u2014$336.6 billion over the last three years.\u00a0Plus, the board recently authorized an additional $110 billion for share buybacks, an amount large enough to purchase almost all the shares of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), just to give you an idea.\n\nWith this move, Apple has shown a clear interest in pleasing investors\u00a0who are\u00a0anxious about its share price\u2019s underperformance this year compared to other big tech companies. As a result, AAPL stock has soared more than 11% since announcing its results, demonstrating its historic ability to bounce back from valuation declines.\n\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe Wall Street consensus on AAPL stock is largely bullish. Out of the 34 Wall Street analysts who have provided recommendations and target prices on the company in the last three months, 22 have issued a Buy rating, 11 have issued a Hold rating, and only one has issued a Sell rating. The average AAPL stock price target is $207.72, indicating upside potential of 8.1%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDespite fears that Apple has missed the AI bandwagon and a few other headwinds, Apple shares have underperformed compared to their big tech peers. But from my perspective, it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\nJune will be a key month for Apple, particularly with advances in AI, which\u00a0should\u00a0bring\u00a0a new cycle of\u00a0updates for iPhones and potentially mark\u00a0a turning point for the company.\n\nGiven Apple\u2019s\u00a0extremely solid\u00a0fundamentals\u2014evidenced by a monumental buyback announcement and significant growth in services that could be the\u00a0major\u00a0catalyst for Apple around AI\u2014I remain bullish on the stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",
