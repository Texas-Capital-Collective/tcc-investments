        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 August 1, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Toyota Motor Corp. TM, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, Chubb Ltd. CB and Pro-Dex, Inc. PDEX.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Toyota, Lockheed Martin and Chubb\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Toyota Motor Corp., Lockheed Martin Corp. and Chubb Ltd., as well as a micro-cap stock Pro-Dex, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nToyota Motor\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past year (+12.4% vs. -11.1%). The company\u2019s robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles is set to fuel sales. To capitalize on the global shift to environment-friendly vehicles, the auto giant is deepening its focus on manufacturing electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company\u2019s product competitiveness.\r\n\r\nToyota Motor aims to expand global sales of BEVs to 1.5 million units in 2026 and 3.5 million units a year by 2030. Toyota\u2019s commitment to maximize shareholders value via dividends and buyback is also praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, labor cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on margins. Rising debt levels, along with high R&D expenses and capex, are set to play spoilsport. Also, Toyota expects sales in Japan to decrease, given the lower shipments of Daihatsu. Thus, the stock warrants a cautious stance now.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Toyota here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+19.1% vs. -4.4%). The company ended second-quarter 2024 on a solid note, with both its earnings and revenues surpassing their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its broad product offerings allow it to secure major defense contracts, which, in turn, boosts its backlog count.\r\n\r\nLockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Its products also witness a strong international demand.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact Lockheed\u2019s operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\r\n\r\nChubb\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+36.2% vs. +25.2%). The company\u2019s suite of compelling products as well as services, focus on capitalizing on the potential of middle-market businesses and investments in various strategic initiatives pave the way for long-term growth.\r\n\r\nSeveral distribution agreements have expanded its network, boosting its market presence. An impressive inorganic growth story helps to achieve a higher long-term return on equity. Chubb expects adjusted net investment income to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.63 billion per quarter in 2024.\r\n\r\nChubb boasts a strong capital position with sufficient cash generation capabilities that ensure steady payouts to investors. Second quarter EPS beat estimates. However, exposure to catastrophe loss induces underwriting volatility. Escalating expenses weigh on margin expansion.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Chubb here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Pro-Dex have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry over the past year (+12.9% vs. -1.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $69.48 million has demonstrated strong financial performance, with net sales increasing 10% year over year to $38.8 million for the nine months ended Mar 31, 2024, reflecting robust demand.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a new 25,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility in Tustin, CA, boosts production capacity and supports future growth. Strategic alliances, such as a supply agreement with Monogram Orthopaedics, enhance market reach and revenue potential. Pro-Dex's strong balance sheet, with $3.2 million in cash and $5.2 million in operating cash flow, ensures financial stability.\r\n\r\nStrong customer relationships, with repeat business from major customers accounting for 85% of net sales, provide a stable revenue stream. However, customer concentration risk, limited market diversification, high operating expenses and competitive pressures are notable headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Pro-Dex here >>>)\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 August 1, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are Best Buy Co., Inc. BBY, The AES Corp. AES, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM and Banco de Chile BCH.\n\n5 High ROE Stocks to Bet On as Markets Seek Rate Cut Clarity\n\nThe broader U.S. equity markets witnessed a modest uptrend over the past few trading days, buoyed by optimism related to rate cuts driven by easing inflationary pressures and solid economic metrics that portrayed the resilience of the economy. In addition, a relatively healthy earnings performance from hitherto reported companies ignited hopes of a possible rate cut as early as September.\n\nThe markets now await the Federal Reserve\u2019s update on the monetary policy as it wraps up its policy meeting later today. Although the Fed is widely expected to keep the benchmark funds rate steady in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, investors are seeking cues for probable cuts in the near future. With a better-than-expected 2.8% annualized GDP growth in the second quarter and a robust labor market scenario, the conditions appear primed to heed the broader sentiments.\n\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of \u201cbacking and filling\u201d in the market, they can benefit from \u201ccash cow\u201d stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Best Buy Co., Inc., The AES Corp., Lockheed Martin Corp., PulteGroup, Inc. and Banco de Chile are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nWhy ROE?\n\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders\u2019 Equity\n\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\n\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry \u2014 the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management\u2019s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nHere are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nBest Buy: Headquartered in Richfield, MN, Best Buy is a multinational specialty retailer of consumer electronics, home office products, entertainment software, communication, food preparation, wellness, health, security, appliances and related services. The company retails technology products in the United States and Canada.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 5.1% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11%, on average.

        "title": "Top Stock Reports for Toyota, Lockheed Martin &amp; Chubb",
        "content": "Wednesday, July 31, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Toyota Motor Corp. (TM), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) and Chubb Ltd. (CB), as well as a micro-cap stock Pro-Dex, Inc. (PDEX). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nToyota Motor\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past year (+12.4% vs. -11.1%). The company\u2019s robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles is set to fuel sales. To capitalize on the global shift to environment-friendly vehicles, the auto giant is deepening its focus on manufacturing electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company\u2019s product competitiveness.\r\n\r\nToyota Motor aims to expand global sales of BEVs to 1.5 million units in 2026 and 3.5 million units a year by 2030. Toyota\u2019s commitment to maximize shareholders value via dividends and buyback is also praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, labor cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on margins. Rising debt levels, along with high R&D expenses and capex, are set to play spoilsport. Also, Toyota expects sales in Japan to decrease, given the lower shipments of Daihatsu. Thus, the stock warrants a cautious stance now.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Toyota here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+19.1% vs. -4.4%). The company ended second-quarter 2024 on a solid note, with both its earnings and revenues surpassing their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its broad product offerings allow it to secure major defense contracts, which, in turn, boosts its backlog count.\r\n\r\nLockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Its products also witness a strong international demand.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact Lockheed\u2019s operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\r\n\r\nChubb\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+36.2% vs. +25.2%). The company\u2019s suite of compelling products as well as services, focus on capitalizing on the potential of middle-market businesses and investments in various strategic initiatives pave the way for long-term growth.\r\n\r\nSeveral distribution agreements have expanded its network, boosting its market presence. An impressive inorganic growth story helps to achieve a higher long-term return on equity. Chubb expects adjusted net investment income to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.63 billion per quarter in 2024.\r\n\r\nChubb boasts a strong capital position with sufficient cash generation capabilities that ensure steady payouts to investors. Second quarter EPS beat estimates. However, exposure to catastrophe loss induces underwriting volatility. Escalating expenses weigh on margin expansion.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Chubb here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Pro-Dex have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry over the past year (+12.9% vs. -1.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $69.48 million has demonstrated strong financial performance, with net sales increasing 10% year over year to $38.8 million for the nine months ended Mar 31, 2024, reflecting robust demand.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a new 25,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility in Tustin, CA, boosts production capacity and supports future growth. Strategic alliances, such as a supply agreement with Monogram Orthopaedics, enhance market reach and revenue potential. Pro-Dex's strong balance sheet, with $3.2 million in cash and $5.2 million in operating cash flow, ensures financial stability.\r\n\r\nStrong customer relationships, with repeat business from major customers accounting for 85% of net sales, provide a stable revenue stream. However, customer concentration risk, limited market diversification, high operating expenses and competitive pressures are notable headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Pro-Dex here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Honeywell International (HON), American Electric Power (AEP) and The Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings. He is frequently quoted in the print and electronic media and publishes the weekly Earnings Trends and Earnings Preview reports.
