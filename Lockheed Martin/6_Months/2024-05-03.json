        "content": "Lockheed Martin's open systems architecture is advancing the future of AI-enabled autonomous flight with human oversight\n\nEDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif., May 3, 2024  /PRNewswire/ -- Lockheed Martin Skunk Works\u00ae (NYSE: LMT) joined the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School and other government and industry partners in hosting U.S. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall to fly in the X-62A Variable In-flight Simulation Test Aircraft (VISTA), a one-of-a-kind aircraft modified to test artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy capabilities. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall, onboard the X-62 VISTA, takes off from Edwards Air Force Base, California, May 2. (Air Force photo by Madeline Guadarrama)\n\nVISTA is an AI pathfinder that facilitates development and testing of cutting-edge AI techniques with new uncrewed vehicle designs. This work is essential to realizing distributed teaming. In less than a year, the teams installed initial live AI agents into the X-62A's systems, demonstrated the first AI versus human dogfight and completed over 100,000 lines of flight-critical software changes across 21 test flights.\n\n\"The need for innovation at speed and scale is greater than ever. The X-62A VISTA is a crucial platform in our efforts to develop, test and integrate AI, as well as to establish AI certification standards that will revolutionize the future of aerospace,\" said John Clark, vice president and general manager, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. \"Our proven hardware and software architecture enable safe and controlled environments for AI agents and advanced algorithms to rapidly prototype and develop.\"\n\nLockheed Martin's open systems architecture, which leverages Skunk Works' Model Following Algorithm (MFA) and System for Autonomous Control of the Simulation (SACS), enables highly complex tests. These important updates enhance VISTA's capabilities while maintaining its rapid-prototyping advantage, allowing for quick changes to software and the ability to conduct flight tests with great frequency, accelerating the pace of AI and autonomy development to meet urgent national defense priorities.\n\nThis architecture has proven to be reliable and robust enough to transition into third-party distributed hardware to replicate safe and controlled flight test objectives as demonstrated by VISTA. Lockheed Martin is at the forefront of fusing AI-enabled platform autonomy with human oversight to accelerate operational speed, maximize agility and cut sustainment costs.\n\nThe achievements of and technologies developed through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program will serve as a foundation for future advances in safer, more reliable, and more efficient aviation \u2013 both for military and commercial domains.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecretary Kendall's flight closely follows several major VISTA recognitions for work done as part of DARPA's ACE program, including being nominated as finalists for the 2023 Robert J. Collier Trophy and receiving the Society of Flight Test Engineers' James S. McDonnell Award and Aviation Week's 2024 Laureate Award for Defense.\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin is a\u00a0global defense technology company driving innovation and advancing scientific discovery. Our all-domain mission solutions and 21st Century Security\u00ae vision accelerate the delivery of transformative technologies to ensure those we serve always stay ahead of ready.

        "title": "Top 20 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 20 states where the US military spends the most money. You can skip our detailed analysis on the breakdown of the Department of Defense (DoD)\u2019s spending by state and head over directly to the Top 5 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money.\n\nFigures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) last month revealed that global military spending reached an all-time high of $2.44 trillion in 2023, increasing 6.8% in real terms compared to 2022. This is the steepest year-on-year rise in defense expenditure since 2009. The report also highlighted that world military expenditure has now been increasing for the last consecutive nine years.\n\nDefense spending in the United States grew 2.3% to total $916 billion in 2023, which amounted to 37.5% of the global military expenditure, and represented 68% of all NATO military spending. On the other hand, Russia\u2019s defense bills also witnessed a 24% increase in 2023 amid the war in Ukraine. Israel\u2019s military expenditure rose 24% as well compared to 2022, driven by its large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza. India and Saudi Arabia also continued to spend heavily on defense during the year.\n\nThe surge in spending has a created a boom in the global defense industry, especially for aerospace and armaments manufacturers in the United States \u2013 a country that accounts for nearly two-fifths of all global military spending, and is home to several top defense contractors countries across the world looks toward to procure their military supplies from.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) generated $67.6 billion in revenues in 2023, reporting an increase of 2.4% in comparison to 2022. The aerospace company\u2019s net earnings were also $1.2 billion higher compared to last year. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s numbers soared as well, with sales reaching a whopping $68.9 billion in 2023, having grown 3% year-on-year. On the other hand, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) posted its highest revenue in history, totaling $42.3 billion last year \u2013 which was 7.3% higher than in 2022.\n\nAs a result, the United States continues to retain its military superiority over its rivals, and given the advanced research and development ongoing in the country\u2019s defense industry, this trend is likely to stay for the foreseeable future. The country is already looking ahead to the future, and working on building weapons tailored to address the rapidly evolving dynamics of modern warfare.\n\nAn example of that is the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Program launched by the United States Air Force (USAF) in 2014 to develop the sixth-generation fighter jet to replace Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s F-22 Raptor. The USAF requested $1.7 billion in its FY24 budget for the project which is likely to cost $16 billion between 2023 and 2028. Five companies \u2013 Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) \u2013 are working on the NGAD Program, with each being awarded contracts worth $975 million in 2022 for a period of ten years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe enormous sums of money that go into the American defense industry for the procurement of new military equipment by the US government and foreign buyers, and the research and development to develop improved weaponry, heavily influences the US economy in many ways. However, the spending is not evenly distributed across all states. Understandably so, states that are home to major defense companies and host a larger number of military installations receive a greater share of this money.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) in September 2023 released a report on its contract obligations and spending across various states of the United States in 2022. Of the $558.7 billion spent that year, 70% went into contracts for products and services, while 28% were used to pay salaries of DoD\u2019s personnel. 2% of the total amount was awarded as grants. Let\u2019s now take a look at top states where the US military spends the most money. Top 20 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money\n\nFrontpage/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nThe top 20 states where the US military spends the most money are ranked in ascending order of the DoD spending by state in billions of dollars. 2022 is the latest year for which data is available, and was released by the Department of Defense in September 2023. In cases where the estimated, rounded figure of defense spending was similar for two or more states, we outranked one over the other on the basis of defense spending per resident, with the state having the greater value ranking higher in the list.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "15 Biggest Aircraft Carriers in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 15 biggest aircraft carriers in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis on trends in the naval industry and head over directly to the 5 Biggest Aircraft Carriers in the World, which includes a $13.3 billion warship!\n\nConflicts in different parts of the world have created a surge in the demand for aircraft carriers. The global industry for these giant war machines is projected to grow 2% between 2023 and 2028, with Asia-Pacific being the fastest growing market for aircraft carriers. These are among the most vital strategic military assets deployed by countries, that allow planes to land on and take off from the sea, that can prove critical during any armed conflict.\n\nThe history of aircraft carriers date back to 1910 when an American pilot, Eugene Ely, flew an aircraft from the deck of a cruiser in Virginia, and then in 1911 made a landing on a battleship in San Francisco Bay. These battleships attained great prominence with the British Navy\u2019s HMS Argus, developed during World War I, and later the USS Langley becoming the first carrier to join the fleet of the US Navy in 1922. However, it was not until the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941 that marked the arrival of aircraft carriers in military conflicts. Since then, several naval powers have focused on developing aircraft carriers, which are now considered as the most potent platform for naval warfare.\n\nToday\u2019s aircraft carriers are not only larger in size, but also come equipped with angled, armored fighting decks, latest electromagnetic and gear technology, steam-powered catapults, and landing signal systems to address complexities faced by older versions due to heavy weights and high landing speeds of aircraft. Moreover, there are also different variants of aircraft carriers in the market, such as nuclear-powered carriers, helicopter carriers, multipurpose carriers, and amphibious assault ships.\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) is among the major players in the industry, and has provided the US Navy with several notable aircraft carriers over the years, including the next-generation Gerald R. Ford class of aircraft carriers, which would equip the American Navy to meet the operational needs of naval combat in the 21st century. These nuclear-powered carriers are being developed to replace the Nimitz class, and would be an improved version of the latter with features allowing greater aircraft deployments, fewer sailors, higher electrical power for ship systems, and a reduction in operating costs per ship by $4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) has been a significant contributor to the strength of the US Navy. Besides building critical warships, the company also provides service facilities for these aircraft carriers while they remain in operation. 2023 was a record-breaking year for Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII), with the company generating $11.5 billion in revenues \u2013 its highest in history, and 7.3% higher compared to 2022.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has also played its role in enhancing the naval strength of the United States by taking an active part in sea-based tests involving aircraft carriers. According to reports, the CVN-79 Gerald R. Ford class carrier, which is scheduled to enter service in July 2025, will be capable of deploying Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s F-35 fighter jets by its next maintenance period.\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)\u2019s expertise in building warships for the US military, especially submarines, has also been widely acclaimed by defense experts for contributing towards America\u2019s naval strength. The company has been lending support for the aircraft carrier programs as well. In April 2023, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was awarded a $847 million contract to repair, maintain, and modernize carriers operated by the US Navy. 15 Biggest Aircraft Carriers in the World\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nThe 15 biggest aircraft carriers in the world are ranked in ascending order of their displacement in tonnes. Data has been sourced from Insider Monkey and Yahoo Finance\u2019s article on the 12 Countries With Most Aircraft Carriers. In cases where two or more carriers had the same level of displacement, we outranked one over the other based on the technological capabilities of the warships.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 16 Strongest Navies in the World in 2024.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of the biggest aircraft carriers in the world by displacement.\n\n15 Biggest Aircraft Carriers in the World:\n\n15. Atlantico\n\nCountry: Brazil\n\nDisplacement: 21,500 tonnes\n\nAtlantico is the only aircraft carrier in South America. The warship was originally built as HMS Ocean and was in use by the Royal Navy in the United Kingdom, before being acquired by Brazil recently in 2018. The country plans on using the aircraft carrier to operate military drones. Atlantico has a displacement of 21,500 tonnes.\n\n14. Juan Carlos I\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nDisplacement: 26,000 tonnes\n\nJuan Carlos I is the only aircraft carrier operated by the Spanish Navy, and is named after the country\u2019s former king. It is the largest warship ever built in Spain's history. The aircraft carrier is powered by a diesel-electric propulsion system, is approximately 231 meters long, with a 32 meters beam, and has the capacity to travel at 21 knots.\n\n13. Izumo\n\nCountry: Japan\n\nDisplacement: 27,000\n\nJapan\u2019s government in 2018 announced that it would convert Kaga and Izumo, its two helicopter carriers, into full-fledged aircraft carriers equipped to allow jets like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s F-35s to land on and take off from. In 2021, US Marine fighters landed on Izumo, signaling the carrier\u2019s transformed capabilities. It has a displacement of an estimated 27,000 tonnes.\n\n12. TCG Anadolu\n\nCountry: Turkiye\n\nDisplacement: 27,000 tonnes\n\nNext on our list of the biggest aircraft carriers in the world is Turkiye\u2019s TCG Anadolu, the country\u2019s only carrier that is equipped with aviation capabilities.
