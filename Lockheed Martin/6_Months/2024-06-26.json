        "title": "3 Defense Stocks to Buy With $875 and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Defense and aerospace companies can be underrated long-term investments. A handful of power players dominate the industry, enjoying competitive advantages thanks to their constant innovation, deep pockets, and strong ties to the U.S. government and its allies.\n\nThey also benefit from the fact that America faces numerous (and varied) threats. At the moment, war and lesser conflicts are taking place in Europe and the Middle East. Meanwhile, emerging national economies (like those in BRICS) have created economic pressure on Western countries like the United States, which has long had tense relationships with some Eastern powers.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that America's strength protects America but it also creates global tension, which means that defense spending will likely be a priority for the U.S. government for the foreseeable future: US Government Defense Spending with Forecast Chart\n\nGeneral Dynamics(NYSE: GD), Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT), and RTX(NYSE: RTX) are three of the world's six largest defense and aerospace companies. Their products and services span land, sea, air, and space, and they are poised to grow for decades to come as key partners in America's defense efforts.\n\nThe best part? You can own stock in all three for under $900.\n\nHere is what you need to know about these three buy-and-hold defense stocks.\n\n1. General Dynamics (trading around $300 a share)\n\nDefense companies understandably depend primarily on government spending for revenue, but General Dynamics offers more diversification than most. Its aerospace unit builds private jets and provides aviation services to companies and high-net-worth clients. The company's marine division is the leading designer and builder of nuclear-powered submarines. Lastly, its combat and technologies segments build land vehicles, weapons systems, and software used for IT and mission control.\n\nPolitics can create volatility, primarily when politicians debate America's defense budget. The budget doesn't always go up, stagnating for periods at a time. That can impact companies like General Dynamics. Still, revenue and earnings have historically marched higher if you're patient enough. GD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThat seems poised to continue. Analysts believe General Dynamics will grow earnings by an average of 12% annually over the long term. This sets investors up for double-digit returns once you factor in the company's 1.9% dividend yield. Those looking for investment exposure to a little bit of everything should give General Dynamics a hard look.\n\n2. Lockheed Martin (trading around $472 a share)\n\nInvestors might have seen the F-35 in the news for its potential $2 trillion lifetime program cost. It's probably fair to say that it is Lockheed Martin's most famous product. However, the defense behemoth builds many products across its business units, including jets and helicopters, naval ships, satellites and spacecraft, missile systems, and cybersecurity offerings. The company's space segment represents nearly a fifth of revenue, making the stock an excellent pick for long-term exposure.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile controversial, the F-35 program has become a cornerstone for America's defense, with a potential runtime through 2088. It arguably sets a high floor for Lockheed Martin's business, which should give investors confidence that it will grow for decades. LMT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nDespite the F-35's presence, analysts are more cautious about Lockheed Martin's growth. Analyst estimates call for annualized growth of 4% for the next three to five years. That sets investors up for high-single-digit returns when factoring in the stock's 2.7% yield. Looking further out, it's hard not to like Lockheed Martin's space unit as a potential growth catalyst down the road. Investors can look at Lockheed Martin as a high-floor, lower-ceiling investment.\n\n3. RTX (trading around $102 a share)\n\nA 2020 merger between Raytheon Technologies and United Technologies formed RTX, the world's largest defense company with $71 billion in annual revenue. RTX has a massive footprint in the aviation sector. Its Collins Aerospace unit sells aircraft, components, and systems to military and commercial clients. At the same time, Pratt & Whitney is a separate unit and leading manufacturer of aircraft engines and auxiliary power units. Its Raytheon segment houses its military offerings, which include weapons, systems, and components for air, land, sea, and space.\n\nThe merger brought with it accounting adjustments and spinoffs that impacted GAAP earnings. However, revenue is at all-time highs, and analysts expect profits to boost back with earnings per share of approximately $5.39 this year. Long-term estimates peg earnings growth at 11% annualized over the long term, so the future looks bright for RTX and its shareholders. RTX Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nLike General Dynamics, RTX offers investors added diversity in commercial business. Pratt & Whitney's leadership in critical aircraft components is a wide-moat competitive advantage that should help the company achieve consistent performance over the years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in General Dynamics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in General Dynamics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and General Dynamics wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Lockheed Martin-Built GOES-U Weather Satellite Successfully Launched",
        "content": "NOAA's newest satellite will complete the GOES-R series and provide\u00a0critical weather and climate data\n\nKENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla., June 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0An advanced weather satellite built by Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) launched today from NASA's Kennedy Space Center at 5:26 p.m. ET. Lifted to space aboard a Space X Falcon Heavy rocket, the GOES-U satellite successfully deployed its large solar array to generate electrical power and has established communications with mission operators. The GOES-U weather satellite launched to space on from Florida on a Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\nGOES-U is the final satellite in NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) - R series of four satellites. After it reaches geostationary orbit, approximately two weeks after launch, GOES-U will be renamed GOES-19. Once in operations over the East Coast of North America, the satellite be known as GOES East, and will provide advanced weather imagery, atmospheric measurements and real-time mapping of lightning activity, in addition to critical space weather observations.\n\n\"The launch of GOES-U is the culmination of more than 16 years of designing, building and launching four important weather satellites for our nation,\" said Jagdeep Shergill, GOES-U program manager and director of Geo Weather Programs at Lockheed Martin. \"Since the launch of the first GOES-R satellite, our nation has had more accurate weather forecasts and more timely severe storm warnings, and this critical service has positively affected everyone in the U.S.\"\n\nNOAA's GOES-R satellites, and soon GOES-U, provide crucial data for weather forecasting, severe storm tracking and climate monitoring. With their advanced instruments and rapid updates, they improve detection of atmospheric phenomena like hurricanes, wildfires and lighting. This real-time data aids the National Weather Service and meteorologist in early warnings, disaster preparedness and resource management, ultimately saving lives and mitigating economic losses.\n\nThe GOES-U spacecraft features two high-tech instruments built by Lockheed Martin's Advanced Technology Center in\u00a0Palo Alto, California:\n\nGeostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), which is a first-of-its-kind operational lightning mapper that tracks lightning\u00a0across the U.S.\u00a0in real-time. GLM allows meteorologists to quickly identify intensifying storms and take appropriate action. In 2020, GLM captured a lightning megaflash nearly 500 miles long that broke the world record for longest lightning flash. Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI), focuses on space weather and measures the sun in extreme ultraviolet wavelength range. SUVI is essential to understanding active areas on the sun and predicting solar events that may disrupt power utilities, communication or navigation systems here on Earth.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOES-U is the final satellite of the GOES-R series which will provide critical weather and climate date into the 2030s. Following GOES-U, Lockheed Martin was selected by NASA to develop the nation's next generation weather satellite constellation, Geostationary Extended Observations (GeoXO), for NOAA. GeoXO's new capabilities will deliver more accurate weather forecasting and address emerging environmental issues and challenges. GeoXO, the GOES-R series and the nation's weather satellites are vital infrastructure for national resilience.\n\nNOAA funds, manages and will operate the GOES-R series satellites. NASA oversees the acquisition and development of the GOES-R spacecraft, instruments and launch vehicles. The program is co-located at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nCheck out additional GOES-U imagery\u00a0here and b-roll video here.\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin is a global defense technology company driving innovation and advancing scientific discovery.
