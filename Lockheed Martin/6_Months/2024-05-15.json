        "content": "Escalating geopolitical tensions have put the aerospace and defense (A&D) industry at a pivotal juncture. With global security concerns at the forefront of national agendas, governments have increased spending on advanced weaponry, sophisticated surveillance systems and cutting-edge military technologies. As a result, Wall Street has been paying close attention to aerospace and defense stocks to buy.\n\nA recent study by Deloitte highlights a robust outlook for the sector.\u00a0 Fueled by global developments, the U.S. defense budget has climbed 3.2% year-over-year (YOY) to a staggering $842 billion for 2024.\u00a0Another study projects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2% for the A&D sector worldwide from 2023 to 2030. Thus, this article introduces three aerospace & defense stocks to buy to capitalize on this dynamic industry.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe global A&D behemoth Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) operates through four main segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems and Space. Its products include fighter jets, combat vehicles, missile defense systems, satellites and next-generation hypersonic weapons.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn late April, the defense technology company reported mixed financial results for the first quarter. Net sales reached $17.2 billion, reflecting a 13.9% YOY increase. But net earnings declined 11.8% compared to the previous year and came in at $1.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) stood at $6.33, a 1.6% drop compared to the previous year quarter.\u00a0Investors noted management has allocated $700 million into research and development (R&D) with the aim focusing on innovation and technology leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, Lockheed Martin won the competitive bid for the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s (MDA) Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program. This development positions Lockheed Martin as the prime contractor responsible for delivering the nation\u2019s most advanced homeland missile defense capability to date. Many analysts point out Lockheed Martin\u2019s ability to secure new contracts, particularly in high-growth areas like space and advanced missile systems.\n\nLMT stock has gained 2.8% year-to-date (YTD) and currently trades near 1-year highs. Yet, its valuation remains compelling at 18.2 times forward earnings and 1.67 times sales. In addition, shares currently have a robust 2.69% dividend yield. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $491.47 for LMT, suggesting potential upside of 5% from current levels. Interested investors can wait for a pull back towards $460 to initiate positions.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD) US tank General Dynamics (GD) Abrams M1A1 in military polygon in the exercise Platinum Lynx 16 on Galati, Romania, 11 December 2015\n\nSource: PhotoStock10 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother top stock pick among aerospace & defense stocks to buy is General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), whose operations span across four major segments: Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems and Technologies. Meanwhile, its products include combat vehicles, nuclear-powered submarines, business jets, communication systems and munitions.\n\nWall Street was pleased with the recent earnings results as revenue climbed to $10.7 billion, marking an 8.6% increase from the previous year. Net earnings reached $799 million, a 9.5% surge compared to the prior-year quarter. This strong performance translated to diluted EPS of $2.88, representing a 9.1% YOY growth. General Dynamics\u2019 profitability metrics are equally impressive. A gross profit margin of over 15% and an operating margin of over 9% indicate efficient management and strong pricing power.\n\nIn late March, Gulfstream Aerospace, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics, announced a significant milestone for its business aviation segment. The all-new Gulfstream G700 has successfully achieved Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification. Management has already announced the first customer deliveries of the Gulfstream G700. Additionally, the increased demand for Combat Systems products, particularly from European and U.S. markets, and the expansion in the Marine Systems segment driven by U.S. Navy\u2019s needs, are pivotal growth areas.\n\nSo far in 2024, GD stock has appreciated a robust 15% and is currently trading at all-time highs and offering a 1.92% dividend yield. Shares are changing hands at 20.4 times forward earnings and 1.9 times sales. And Wall Street remains optimistic for the prospects of GD stock with a 12-month median price forecast of $316. Such an up move could potentially mean an almost 7.5% increase in GD price.\n\niShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) A photograph of two jet fighters flying above clouds. defense stocks. Defense Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRounding out our discussion on A&D investments is the iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:ITA) an industry-focused fund. Since its inception in May 2006, net assets have grown close to $6.4 billion.\n\nAmong ITA\u2019s 34 holdings, the top 10 names comprise about three-quarters of the fund. This concentration of heavyweights allows investors to tap into the performance of industry leaders like RTX (NYSE:RTX), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin, Howmet Aerospace (NYSE:HWM), and TransDigm Group(NYSE:TDG). These companies are the backbone of the sector, driving innovation and shaping the future of A&D.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, ITA has gained 7.1%, and it offers a dividend yield of 0.82%. Meanwhile, the fund\u2019s trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 31.2x. Given the geopolitical environment and growing importance of aerospace and defense, we\u2019re bullish on the ITA, but would consider buying after a pullback towards the $125 level. Finally, interested investors should also note the annual expense ratio of 0.95%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Secures a $861M Contract to Build HIMARS",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently clinched a contract involving High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). The award has been provided by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.\n\nValued at $861.3 million, the contract is expected to be completed by May 31, 2026.\u00a0 Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will manufacture HIMARS and provide the supporting services associated with it.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Lockheed?\n\nNations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, increased spending has been witnessed on missile capabilities, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like Lockheed Martin, which enjoy a dominant position in the development of missiles.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative to mention that LMT\u2019s HIMARS is the most technically advanced, affordable and sustainable artillery solution that provides cutting-edge technology on an indigenous platform. HIMARS provides unmatched long-range mobile firepower to support Joint All-Domain Operations. It can launch the entire Multiple Launch Rocket System family of munitions.\n\nSuch remarkable features of the HIMARS are likely to have been boosting its demand significantly. This can be gauged from the fact that Lockheed has already increased the production capacity of HIMARS from 48 per year to 60 per year.\n\nGrowth Prospect\n\nThe global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility prevalent in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks. As the demand for missiles is on the rise, so is the demand for missile launchers like HIMARS.\n\nTherefore, the growth prospect for the missile and missile defense systems market remains solid. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the missile and missile defense systems market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.\n\nLMT\u2019s proficiency in manufacturing missiles and associated missile launchers, particularly that of HIMARS, positions it favorably to capitalize on the growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market. The fact that Lockheed Martin remains on track to double the production of its HIMARS to 96 per year by the end of 2024, makes us confident that the company will witness more order flows for this product, like the latest one. Such contract wins, in turn, are likely to boost revenue growth for the company\u2019s MFC unit, which witnessed a solid 25.3% year-over-year growth in its top line in the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nLMT apart, other prominent defense contractors that stand to benefit from the expanding missile and missile defense systems market are as follows:\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.\n\nNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop\u2019s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nGeneral Dynamics GD: General Dynamics\u2019 Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It is a key supplier of major strategic and tactical missile programs ranging from warheads to missile housings, structural components to solid rocket motor cases.\n\nGD has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11%. The consensus estimate for General Dynamics\u2019 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 10.5% from the 2023 reported figure.\r\n\r\nRTX Corp. RTX: RTX\u2019s business unit, Missiles and Defense, is a prominent U.S. missile maker. Its portfolio includes the AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, the AIM-9X Block II missile, RAM-guided missile weapon system, etc. In a partnership with BAE Systems, RTX has built the Excalibur artillery projectile, which increases precision, minimizes collateral damage and reduces the logistical burden for artillery forces.\n\nRTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of Lockheed Martin have risen 3.4% against the industry\u2019s 7.8% decline.

        "content": "As we venture further into 2024, the rapidly evolving space industry presents an array of tantalizing investment prospects. With governments and private enterprises intensifying their space pursuits, savvy investors are setting their sights on the stars. In this article, we\u2019ll talk about three space stocks to buy that I feel have the best value in the market right now.\n\nThe UN-Portugal policy symposium on the \u201cManagement and Sustainability of Outer Space Activities\u201d highlighted the urgent need for inclusive and sustainable space governance, especially in light of recent advancements in the private space sector.\n\nThis, to me, is a bullish sign, as it indicates the space industry is rapidly developing and becoming a key talking point. Although we may be in the very earliest stages of witnessing its commercialization, I also feel this is where we will see the most opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, with that being said, here are three space stocks to buy for investors this year.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) provides launch services and space systems solutions, including satellite deployment and spacecraft design.\n\nThe Electron small orbital launch vehicle, the Photon satellite platform and the upcoming Neutron launch vehicle are central to its portfolio. I see the most promise coming from its Neutron vehicle, slated to significantly improve its EBITDA over the long run.\n\nFor 2024, Rocket Lab provided an optimistic outlook. The company expects earnings to grow, with EPS forecasted to improve from ($0.41) to ($0.23) per share. Analysts maintain a Moderate Buy rating on RKLB stock, with an average price target indicating potential upside. Revenue for Q1 2024 was $92.8 million, up 69% year-over-year.\n\nDespite some launch failures over the past year and other operational hiccups, I am still firmly bullish on RKLB, given its tiny valuation at just $4.16 per share at the time of writing. That makes it one of those space stocks for investors to consider.\n\nAstra (ASTR) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American aerospace company Astra Space on screen in front of web page.. ASTR stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAstra (NASDAQ:ASTR) focuses on providing cost-effective launch services for smaller satellites. The company\u2019s innovative rocket designs aim to make space more accessible.\n\nIn 2023, Astra reported significant financial losses, including a GAAP net loss of $29.7 million for Q3 and adjusted EBITDA losses across multiple quarters. Revenues were relatively low, with Q2 revenue at $0.71 million and Q3 revenue at $0.26 million.\n\nFor 2024, however, Astra is focusing on enhancing its launch capabilities and expanding its product offerings. The company aims to increase revenues and improve margins by optimizing operations and securing new contracts. Analysts predict earnings growth, with projected EPS improving from ($2.40) to ($1.80) per share for upcoming quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nSatellite constellations are becoming increasingly popular, with around 2.6 billion of the world\u2019s population without internet access. That\u2019s because it\u2019s physically impossible to connect some remote regions around the world, and satellites offer a solution to this. They are also used as a form of secure communication networks for governments and corporations.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a leading defense and aerospace company involved in numerous space projects, including satellite development and space launch systems.\n\nThe company has significantly ramped up its production of small satellites, responding to increased demand from defense and intelligence agencies. Lockheed Martin recently opened a new small satellite assembly facility near Denver, Colorado, capable of manufacturing 180 spacecraft per year.\n\nOne of Lockheed Martin\u2019s notable projects is the collaboration with NASA on its Artemis program. The company is also developing a human-rated Moon rover as part of NASA\u2019s Lunar Terrain Vehicle Services (LTVS) contract.\n\nThe broader point of why I like LMT is that it\u2019s one of the leading defense stocks in the world, supplying many NATO and neutral countries with the tools they need to defend themselves. It has a great total return history, outpacing the S&P 500 over the long-term charts, and has a strong 3-year dividend growth rate of 7.43%.\n\nThat makes it a diversified pick, with the space industry being a separate growth headwind in addition to the rising geopolitical tensions that fuel LMT\u2019s valuation upwards.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with LLAP.\n\nRelease Date: May 14, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nTerran Orbital Corp reported a significant backlog of $400 million, indicating strong future revenues primarily from Lockheed Martin over the next 18-24 months. The company has successfully delivered 10 satellites for the Transport Layer Tranche 0 to Lockheed Martin and the Space Development Agency in just 26 months from contract award, showcasing improved production speed. Terran Orbital Corp is expanding its manufacturing capabilities, with a new 94,000 square foot facility expected to open by Q1 2025, enhancing their capacity to meet growing demand. The company has over $25 billion of identified pipeline across 140 programs, demonstrating potential for substantial growth and diversification in customer base and market segments. Terran Orbital Corp has strengthened its vertical integration, controlling more of its supply chain, which is crucial for maintaining schedule and cost efficiencies in satellite manufacturing.\n\nNegative Points\n\nRevenue for Q1 2024 was down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable EAC adjustments on a single program caused by subcontractor challenges. The company reported a gross loss of $6.2 million for Q1 2024, compared to a gross loss of $1.4 million in the previous year, with adjusted gross loss worsening due to subcontractor issues. Terran Orbital Corp is experiencing delays in some programs, which could impact short-term revenue recognition and cash flow. The strategic review process initiated due to an acquisition proposal from Lockheed Martin is still ongoing, creating uncertainty about the company's future direction. Despite efforts to become EBITDA positive, the company faced a negative adjusted EBITDA of $28.2 million in Q1 2024, indicating ongoing profitability challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Can you provide details on the value per satellite in the new contract with Lockheed compared to the previous awards? A: Marc Bell, CEO of Terran Orbital, explained that the tracking layer satellites in the new contract are more sophisticated than those in the previous transport layer, justifying a higher price per satellite due to the increased complexity and stability required for their payloads.\n\nQ: What is the expected revenue ramp for this year, especially with the backlog and upcoming deliveries? A: Marc Bell mentioned that with nearly 50 space vehicles being delivered this year, significant revenue ramp-up is expected particularly in Q3 and Q4 as deliveries continue throughout the year.\n\nQ: How are you progressing towards profitability, especially considering the ramp-up in the second half of the year? A: Marc Bell indicated a potential for achieving quarterly profitability by Q4, depending on the execution of incoming programs. He highlighted that increased automation and internal production are improving yield and reducing dependency on subcontractors, which supports the drive towards EBITDA positivity.\n\nQ: Can you discuss the cash flow conversion of the $400 million non-robotic backlog over the next 18 to 24 months? A: Marc Bell clarified that cash flow from the backlog is milestone-based and varies significantly between programs, with some having front-loaded and others back-loaded cash flows.\n\nQ: What are the implications of the EAC adjustments and delayed revenue recognized this quarter? A: Mathieu Riffel, Acting CFO, explained that the negative EAC adjustments are mainly timing issues within their accounting model. He assured that the total contract value remains fixed and the revenue will be recognized in future periods.\n\nQ: Given the upcoming election year, are there any concerns about the impact on Terran Orbitals government contracts? A: Marc Bell expressed confidence in the stability of their core DoD work, noting that these programs are essential and cost-effective compared to other available options, thereby likely to be less affected by potential political shifts.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",
