        "title": "Lockheed Rides on Solid Order Growth Despite Labor Shortage",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s LMT steady inflow of orders for its diverse defense products is likely to boost its revenues. The company holds a strong solvency position as well as a solid presence in the international defense market.\r\n\r\nHowever, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company faces risks like the shortage of skilled labor and sanctions imposed by China, which act as a headwind.\n\nTailwinds Favoring LMT\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Lockheed kept up with its tradition of securing several significant contracts from the Pentagon and other American allies. One of these contracts, worth $4.1 billion, requires Lockheed to design new capabilities for its command and control, battle management and communications system. Such contracts culminate into a solid backlog count, which boosts LMT\u2019s revenue generation prospects.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin's products not only have an impressive domestic market presence but also gain international recognition. International customers of the company have shown a great deal of interest in its THAAD system and PAC-3 missiles, with 15 countries having selected the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement and PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative to improve their missile defense capabilities.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2024, Lockheed had $2.52 billion in cash and cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2024, its current debt came in at $0.14 billion and was much less than its cash reserve. Thus, it is reasonable to say that the stock boasts a solid solvency position in the near term.\n\nHeadwinds Faced by LMT\n\nIndustry participants like Lockheed continue to be at risk from the labor crisis, particularly with regard to skilled workers. These labor shortages may make it difficult for manufacturing companies like Lockheed to deliver finished products on schedule, which might affect its operating performance going forward.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, the China Ministry of Commerce declared that Lockheed had been placed on its list of \"unreliable entities\" in relation to certain foreign military sales made by the U.S. government to Taiwan involving LMT\u2019s products and services. In this regard, China declared that it would impose certain sanctions against Lockheed.\u00a0 If China imposes further sanctions on LMT, the company's business may suffer.\n\nLMT Stock Price Movement\n\nIn the past three months, shares of LMT have risen 21.9% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 2.9%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Leidos Holdings, Inc. LDOS, Curtiss-Wright Corp. CW and Leonardo DRS, Inc. DRS, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nLeidos\u2019 long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 12.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LDOS\u2019 2024 sales suggests an improvement of 5.4% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nCurtiss-Wright delivered an average earnings surprise of 11.52% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 revenues suggests a rise of 7% from the 2023 reported sales figure.\r\n\r\nLeonardo DRS\u2019 long-term earnings growth rate is 16.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DRS\u2019 total revenues for 2024 indicates year-over-year growth of 11.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 September 4, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Meta Platforms META, Lockheed Martin LMT and Eli Lilly LLY.\n\n3 Big Winners from Q2 Earnings Season: META, LMT, LLY\n\nThe 2024 Q2 earnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering quarterly results. Looking ahead, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, chaining together consecutive periods of positivity.\n\nSeveral companies have stolen the spotlight throughout the period, including Meta Platforms, Lockheed Martin and Eli Lilly. All three posted robust results and upped guidance, with shares of each seeing bullish activity post earnings.\n\nLet's take a closer look at each.\n\nMETA Raises AI CapEx\n\nMega-cap giant Meta Platforms was one of the few Mag 7 members to see a positive reaction to its quarterly results, with the company again exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. The company's earnings outlook reflects bullishness across all timeframes.\n\nThe company delivered a stunning statement in the release, with Mark Zuckerberg saying, 'We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\"\n\nHe continued, \"We've released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.\"\n\nMeta also raised its CapEx outlook into a band of $37 - $40 billion ($35 - $40 billion prior) to support its artificial intelligence roadmap.\n\nThe valuation picture for META remains attractive, with the current 22.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 31.5X. In addition, the current PEG ratio works out to 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\n\nEli Lilly Sees Robust Demand\n\nEli Lilly shares have been red-hot in 2024 thanks to robust results stemming from unrelenting demand, up 65% and widely outperforming relative to the S&P 500. Shares popped following its latest release, with earnings and sales climbing 85% and 35%, respectively.\n\nThe company upgraded its current-year sales guidance by a sizable $3 billion. Analysts have adjusted their sales expectations accordingly, with the now $46.4 billion expected alluding to a 35% climb year-over-year.\n\nThe story behind Eli Lilly has been driven by its diabetes drug Mounjaro and its weight loss injection Zepbound, which have seen unrelenting demand among consumers. Mounjaro sales jumped 216% year-over-year, whereas Zepbound sales of $1.2 billion also reflected strong demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings expectations have shot higher across the board following the release, with LLY sporting a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nLMT Generates Significant Cash\n\nLockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, operating in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology. The company's steady growth continued throughout its latest period, with EPS and revenue growing 6% and 9%, respectively.\n\nThe company has been a long-time favorite among income-focused investors, consistently upping its payout over the years. LMT's cash-generating abilities have aided its dividend growth, with the company posting nearly $1.3 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.\n\nFollowing the favorable quarter, LMT upped its EPS, segment profit, and sales guidance, causing shares to move bullishly following the release.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Q2 earnings season overall showed resiliency, with no major spooks hitting the tape. While we saw some mixed reads on the consumer, recent favorable economic data helps alleviate this issue.\n\nAnd concerning a few companies who stole the spotlight during the reporting period, these three stocks all did precisely that.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.
