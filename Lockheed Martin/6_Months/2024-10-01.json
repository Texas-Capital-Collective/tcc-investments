        "title": "Northrop Wins a Contract for Active Electronically Scanned Array Radars",
        "content": "Northrop Grumman Corp.\u2019s NOC business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems, recently secured a modification contract to supply active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars for the U.S. Air Force\u2019s F-16 aircraft fleet. The award has been offered by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $30 million, this contract is projected to be completed by May 30, 2031. Work related to this deal will be executed in Linthicum Heights, MD.\n\nThe latest modification brought the total face value of the agreement to $1.67 billion.\n\nNOC Stock\u2019s Place in the Radar Market\n\nNorthrop is a prominent player in the radar market. Its Mission Systems business segment offers multiple radars and associated products like the Scalable Agile Beam Radar, F-35 fire control radar and Distributed Aperture System, Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR,) APR-39 DV(2) and EV(2) Radar Warning Receiver programs and a few more.\n\nAs far as its expertise in AESA radar is concerned, Northrop has been at the forefront of AESA innovations for more than 60 years. Its well-earned expertise in AESA fire control radars helps provide air-to-air, air-to-ground, land and sea superiority for the world\u2019s armed forces. Impressively, the company\u2019s airborne fire control radars are used in the U.S. Air Force\u2019s 5th generation fighter platforms, the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II, apart from F-16 jets.\n\nThis surely reflects the solid demand that Northrop\u2019s AESA enjoys in the U.S. military aerospace industry. The latest contract win is yet another example of that.\n\nGrowth Opportunities for NOC Stock\n\nWith widespread geopolitical tensions engulfing the global peace map in recent years, resulting in cross-border conflicts as well as civil unrest within a nation, multiple nations have been investing significantly to effectively strengthen their military arsenal. As radars constitute a crucial component of this arsenal, rising defense spending has also been boosting investments in radar manufacturing and associated components. The growth prospects for the radar market thus remain bright.\n\nThis must have prompted the Markets and Markets firm to project a CAGR of 5.2% for the global military radar market in the 2024-2029 period. Such growth projections bode well for prominent radar manufacturers like NOC.\n\nIn addition to being a prime provider of AESA radars, Northrop develops radar systems that support complex missions at sea and counter increasingly sophisticated anti-ship threats. Its AN/SPQ-9B is a multimode X-band pulse Doppler radar that detects all known and projected sea-skimming missiles. The company also offers land-based radars like AN/TPS-80 G/ATOR, HAMMR and the AN/TPS-80 Long Range Radar, which provide a complete, operational picture and unambiguous view of the battlespace to help warfighters make better decisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nNOC Stock\u2019s Peer Prospects\n\nOther prominent radar manufacturers that are expected to benefit from the aforementioned growth opportunities offered by the global military radar market are discussed below:\n\nRTX Corp.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT recently secured a contract valued at $3.23 billion for the procurement of Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (\"JASSM\") and Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles (\"LRASM\"). The work related to this deal will be carried out in Orlando, FL, and is projected to be completed by July 31, 2032.\r\n\r\nThe award has been provided by the U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Eglin Air Force Base, FL. The contract will serve the governments of Japan, the Netherlands, Finland and Poland.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring LMT?\n\nWith countries worldwide enhancing their defense capabilities, spending on advanced military arms and ammunition has been rapidly increasing. This also includes growing investments in missiles and missile defense systems, which are crucial for warfare missions. Lockheed Martin, as a prominent manufacturer of missiles and missile defense systems, thus continues to witness a steady flow of orders from the Pentagon and U.S. allies. The latest contract win is an example of that.\r\n \r\nNotably, Lockheed Martin\u2019s first cruise missile, JASSM, provides continued significant long-range, precision engagement capabilities for air-to-ground missions. The combat-proven and mission-effective weapon system is designed to destroy high-value, well-defended, fixed and relocatable targets from significant standoff range, keeping aircrews well out of danger from hostile air defense systems without compromising lethality or reach.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, LRASM is a precision-guided intelligent anti-ship missile designed to prevent a variety of surface threats at very long ranges. It can navigate semi-autonomously to a target and deliver a precise payload from a safe standoff range.\r\n\r\nSuch notable features of the aforementioned missiles of Lockheed Martin are likely to have been boosting their demand, which is further evident from the latest contract win.\n\nLMT\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nRising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes have led nations to increase their focus on national security, particularly on missile defense systems, backed by the rapid development of advanced missile technologies over the last decade.\r\n \r\nThis is likely to have prompted Mordor Intelligence to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 5% for the missiles and missile defense systems market during the 2024-2029 time period.\r\n\r\nThis should benefit Lockheed Martin, with its Missile and Fire Control unit being a recognized developer of high-performance missiles. The unit pursues business in more than 50 countries worldwide. Some of its major programs are the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense air and missile defense programs as well. Its prominent missiles include Precision Strike Missile, Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles and Hellfire II Missiles.\n\nStory continues\n\nProspects of LMT\u2019s Peers\n\nOther defense companies that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding missiles and missile system market have been discussed below.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation NOC: Northrop Grumman provides high-speed, long-range strike weapons like the AARGM-ER, which is a supersonic, air-launched tactical missile system. It also develops and builds advanced missile defense technology, ranging from command systems to directed energy weapons, advanced munitions and powerful sensors.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 5.4%.\r\n\r\nRTX Corporation RTX: It is known for its missile defense systems like the Patriot and SM-6, which are in high demand globally. RTX also provides advanced sensors and interceptors to identify, track and defeat threats as part of a layered missile defense.\r\n \r\nThe company\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 10.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 7%.\r\n\r\nThe Boeing Company BA: It manufactures various missile defense systems, including the Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Avenger. Boeing-built and supported air and missile defense systems have been protecting its customers for nearly 25 years against threats ranging from intercontinental ballistic missiles to hostile aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 21.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA\u2019s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 20%.\n\nLMT Stock\u2019s Price Movement\n\nShares of LMT have gained 26.2% in the past three months compared with the industry\u2019s 10.9% growth.

        "title": "RTX Secures a $1.3B Deal to Improve F135 Engine Capabilities",
        "content": "RTX Corporation\u2019s RTX business segment, Pratt & Whitney, recently secured a contract worth up to $1.3 billion to continue working on the F135 Engine Core Upgrade (\u201cECU\u201d), which will increase the engine's longevity. These upgraded F135 engines, once integrated into the F-35 jets, are expected to boost this fighter aircraft\u2019s performance.\n\nRTX\u2019s F135 Engine Core Upgrade Benefits\n\nThe ECU is an upgrade developed by Pratt & Whitney for its F135 engines to provide an affordable, low-risk and agile pathway for enhancing propulsion capability for all three variants of F-35 jets. The ECU is the only engine that offers all global F-35 operators the additional power and thermal management capacity needed to enable next-generation weapons systems and sensors.\r\n\r\nThe ECU upgrade will meet the necessary requirements for the Block 4 upgrade of F-35 jets, which is aimed at enabling the F-35 aircraft to carry more weapons and improve its electronic warfare capabilities. \r\n\r\nThe fact that the F135 ECU is expected to generate tens of billions of lifecycle cost savings makes it the most cost-effective solution for the block 4 upgrade of F-35 jets. The recent contract win is a testament to that.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring RTX?\n\nAmid the rising geopolitical unrest worldwide, countries are rapidly increasing their military spending to improve their capacity for battle. With aerial security being an important section of a nation\u2019s defense map, there remains solid demand for combat-proven jets like the F-35.\r\n\r\nBuilt by America's largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, the F-35 enjoys a profitable position in the combat aircraft market, with this aircraft being the most lethal fighter jet worldwide. One of its most recent developments is the Czech Republic's intention to buy 24 F-35s, becoming the 18th nation to join the F-35 global team in the first quarter of 2024. This suggests that demand for Lockheed's F-35 fighter is skyrocketing.\r\n\r\nThe increased demand for the F-35 allows RTX, the manufacturer of the jet's engine, F135, to get a steady stream of orders from the Pentagon, U.S. allies and other international customers. Pratt & Whitney has delivered almost 1,200 F135 engines to date.\r\n\r\nThe production of LMT\u2019s F-35 jets is expected to continue for several years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy. This should boost the demand for F135 engines and can be expected to boost its order growth in the near future. Such order growth should boost the top line of RTX\u2019s Pratt & Whitney unit, which registered 19% year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nProspects for RTX\u2019s Peers\n\nThe aforementioned F-35 inventory target should also benefit other defense majors like Northrop Grumman NOC and BAE Systems BAESY, which are involved in the production of this aircraft.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman produces the F-35 aircraft's center fuselage, the AN/APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array radar and communications subsystems and provides sustainment support for the Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System. Moreover, NOC\u2019s Integrated Communications, Navigation, and Identification, incorporated in F-35 jets, is one of the most advanced integrated avionics systems ever engineered to enhance pilot effectiveness.\r\n\r\nNorthrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales suggests growth of 5.4% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nBAE Systems is another key partner in the manufacturing of F-35 jets. The rear fuselage of every F-35 in the global fleet has been built by BAE Systems. It also manufactures vertical and horizontal tails for F-35 jets. The company provides an electronic warfare package for the F-35 that includes a fully integrated radar warning (targeting support and self-protection) to detect and eliminate surface and airborne threats.\r\n\r\nBAE Systems boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY\u2019s 2024 sales implies an improvement of 37.4% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nRTX Stock Price Movement\n\nIn the past six months, shares of RTX have risen 22.9% compared with the industry\u2019s 6.7% growth.
