        "content": "(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin on Thursday agreed to acquire satellite products maker Terran Orbital in a $450 million deal, months after the defense contractor withdrew it previous bid to take it private.\n\nLockheed will pay 25 cents per share in cash, representing a 37.5% discount to Terran's last close. The company in March had offered $1 per Terran share.\n\nTerran's shares plunged nearly 41% to 24 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nLockheed, which had invested in Terran's Series A round in 2017, is its largest customer and currently uses the company's satellite bus for the U.S. Space Development Agency's (SDA) transport and tracking layer programs.\n\n\"The acquisition consolidates a supplier, with Terran Orbital providing buses for Lockheed's prime position on the SDA's Tracking and Transport layer,\" analysts said in a Jefferies note.\n\nFlorida-based Terran Orbital is engaged in satellite design, production, launch planning, mission operations, and on-orbit support for aerospace and defense clients.\n\nThe transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, will retire Terran's existing debt and establish a new $30 million working capital facility.\n\nA month back, Terran posted quarterly net loss of $35.4 million, adding to several quarters of losses since going public in 2022.\n\nEarlier this year, Lockheed was awarded $890 million as part of a $2.55 billion contract along with peers L3Harris Technologies and Sierra Space to deliver 18 satellites to the SDA as part of its missile tracking program.\n\n(Reporting by Aatreyee Dasgupta in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)",

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Lockheed Martin is US$754 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Lockheed Martin is estimated to be 25% undervalued based on current share price of US$563 The US$547 analyst price target for LMT is 27% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nThe Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$6.28b US$6.68b US$7.09b US$7.13b US$7.20b US$7.31b US$7.44b US$7.59b US$7.75b US$7.93b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x8 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 1.06% Est @ 1.49% Est @ 1.80% Est @ 2.01% Est @ 2.15% Est @ 2.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1%  US$5.9k US$5.9k US$5.9k US$5.6k US$5.4k US$5.1k US$4.9k US$4.7k US$4.6k US$4.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$53b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$7.9b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (6.1%\u2013 2.5%) = US$229b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$229b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$127b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$180b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$563, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.862. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Lockheed Martin\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace & Defense market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company.
