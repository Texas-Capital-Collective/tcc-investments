        "content": "In this article, we discuss the most powerful military in the world. We have created a list of 25 most powerful militaries, for full free list, visit Top 25 Powerful Countries in the World by Military Strength.\n\nFigures released last month by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimated the global defense expenditure at $2.44 trillion for 2023, a record-high, having risen 6.8% compared to the previous year. This was the biggest spike in military spending since 2009, and the ninth successive year during which military expenditure had risen.\n\nThe United States represented 37.5% of the world\u2019s overall defense expenditure, having spent $916 billion during the year. This figure, which grew 2.3% from 2022, amounted to 68% of all NATO spending in 2023. In Europe, $588 billion were spent on military expenses, which made up around one-fourths (24%) of the global expenditure. This was 16% more than in 2022, and 64% higher than a decade ago in 2014. Both Moscow and Kyiv substantially increased their military expenditure, while several other countries in the continent also bolstered their defenses with war returning to Europe after decades of peace.\n\nMoreover, $560 billion was incurred on military expenditure in Asia, with the figure having risen 40% compared to 2014. The major chunk of this spending came from East Asia and South Asia, while countries in the Middle East also spent hefty amounts on bolstering their national security.\n\nThe surge in global military spending since the beginning of the war in Ukraine has meant a boom for major corporations in the defense industry. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East, which started in October 2023, has also bolstered their finances. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s stocks have spiked 29% since Russia invaded Ukraine. In 2023, the company generated $67.6 billion in revenue, which represented a 2.4% increase from 2022. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s net earnings for the year were also $1.2 billion higher than the previous year.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s numbers are also soaring. The company posted a whopping $68.9 billion in revenue in 2023, nearly 60% of which came from defense related sales. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has received orders worth $3 billion alone for its AMRAAM rockets that have been instrumental for Ukraine in pushing back advancing Russian troops. Last year in March, the company was awarded a $1.2 billion contract from Germany as well to develop Patriot air and missile defense systems for the country. Later in November during the same year, Hungary received the first two units of the NASAMS air defense system it ordered from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) recorded its highest revenue in history in 2023, totaling $42.3 billion, a year-on-year increase of 7.3%. The company\u2019s artillery production went up last year from 14,000 rounds per month to 20,000. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)\u2019s 155-millimeter artillery replacements have played a vital role in leading Ukraine\u2019s fightback against Russia. These have been regularly provided by the Americans to Kyiv as part of Washington\u2019s military assistance. Nearly three-fourths of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)\u2019s overall revenue comes from defense-related sales. The Most Powerful Country in the World by Military Strength\n\nBPTU/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have considered thirteen weighted metrics to rank the top 25 powerful countries in the world by military strength. These include GDP and defense spending (25%); strength of ground forces (25%) which comprised manpower, tanks, artillery, and nuclear weapons; fleet of military aircraft (20%); naval assets including aircraft carriers and submarines (10%); military technological advancement (10%); military satellites in orbit (5%); overseas military bases (3%); and cyber-capabilities (2%).\n\nIt was observed where each country ranked on a given metric, and assigned them weighted ranking scores. Finally, weighted scores for each metric were summed to get an overall score. Additional 5%, or 0.05 points, were added to the tally of countries that had battle-hardened troops. The most powerful countries in the world by military strength are ranked in ascending order of their overall scores.\n\nData related to GDP figures for countries in 2023 was sourced from the IMF, while SIPRI was consulted for figures related to defense expenditure during the year. For other metrics, we considered Insider Monkey\u2019s recent articles: 20 Largest Air Forces in the World Heading into 2024, 15 Countries with the Most Battle Tanks in the World, Artillery Strength by Country: Top 20 Militaries, 15 Navies with the Most Submarines in the World, 12 Countries With Most Aircraft Carriers, 13 Countries With The Most Overseas Military Bases, 15 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Satellites in Orbit, and 12 Most Advanced Countries in Cybersecurity. Moreover, for manpower we referred to the Global Firepower Index 2024, whereas Power Atlas was considered for information related to nuclear weapons. Lastly, the Global Innovation Index 2023 was referenced for technological capabilities.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.
