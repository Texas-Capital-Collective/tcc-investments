        "title": "Why Lockheed (LMT) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again",
        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Lockheed Martin (LMT), which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis aerospace and defense company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9.69%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Lockheed came out with earnings of $7.11 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.45 per share, representing a surprise of 10.23%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $5.80 per share and it actually produced earnings of $6.33 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.14%.\n\nFor Lockheed, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nLockheed has an Earnings ESP of +5% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 22, 2024.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT has secured a $1.17 billion contract to provide crucial fleet support for the Trident II Strategic Weapon System. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed Martin will offer shipboard integration as well as support the development of navigation subsystems for the Trident II missile.\r\n\r\nMost of the work under this contract will take place in Mitchel Field, NY. The award has been provided by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, DC. The deal is expected to be completed by Sept. 29, 2031.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring LMT?\n\nWith countries worldwide enhancing their defense capabilities, spending on advanced military arms and ammunition has been rapidly increasing. This also includes growing investments in missiles and missile systems, which are crucial for warfare missions. Lockheed Martin, as a prominent manufacturer of missiles and missile defense systems, has thus been witnessing a steady flow of orders for its combat-proven missiles from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies. The latest contract win is an example of that.\r\n \r\nLMT's Trident II D5 is one of the most advanced ballistic missiles available. It's a three-stage missile that uses solid fuel and is guided by an internal system. The missile can travel up to 4,000 nautical miles and can carry multiple warheads that can hit different targets independently.\r\n\r\nSuch notable features of the aforementioned missiles of Lockheed Martin are likely to have been boosting their demand, which is further evident from the latest contract win.\n\nLMT\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nRising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes have led nations to increase their focus on national security, particularly on missile and missile defense systems, backed by the rapid development of advanced missile technologies over the last decade.\r\n \r\nThis is likely to have prompted Mordor Intelligence to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 5% for the global missiles and missile defense systems market during the 2024-2029 time period.\r\n\r\nThis should benefit Lockheed Martin, with its Missile and Fire Control unit being a recognized developer of high-performance missiles. The unit pursues business in more than 50 countries worldwide. Some of its major programs are the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense air and missile defense programs as well. Its prominent missiles include the Precision Strike Missile, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile and Long Range AntiShip Missile.\n\nProspects of LMT\u2019s Peers\n\nOther defense companies that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding global missiles and missile system market have been discussed below.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation NOC: Northrop Grumman provides high-speed, long-range strike weapons like the AARGM-ER, which is a supersonic, air-launched tactical missile system. It also develops and builds advanced missile defense technology, ranging from command systems to directed energy weapons, advanced munitions and powerful sensors.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 5.4%.\r\n\r\nRTX Corporation RTX: It is well known for its missile defense systems like the Patriot and SM-6, which are in high demand globally. RTX also provides advanced sensors and interceptors to identify, track and defeat threats as part of a layered missile defense.\r\n \r\nThe company\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 10.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 7%.\r\n\r\nThe Boeing Company BA: It manufactures various missile defense systems, including the Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Avenger. Boeing-built and supported air and missile defense systems have been protecting its customers for nearly 25 years against threats ranging from intercontinental ballistic missiles to hostile aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 21.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA\u2019s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 22.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLMT Stock\u2019s Price Movement\n\nShares of LMT have gained 32.3% in the past three months compared with the industry\u2019s 10.2% growth.
