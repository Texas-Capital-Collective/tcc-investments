        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 most powerful states in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global defense industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Powerful States in the US.\n\nThe Global Defense Industry: Powers in Motion\n\nThe global defense industry is experiencing significant growth driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions. According to new data on global military spending published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), total global military expenditure reached $2.443 trillion in 2023, marking a 6.8% increase in real terms from the previous year. This rise represents the steepest year-on-year increase since 2009, driven primarily by escalating tensions and conflicts around the world. The ten largest military spenders, including the US, China, and Russia, all raised their defense budgets.\n\nNotably, Russia's military spending surged by 24% to an estimated $109 billion in 2023, reflecting a 57% increase since 2014. In 2023, Ukraine's military spending was 59% of Russia\u2019s military spending. Ukraine also received at least $35 billion in military aid from various countries, including $25.4 billion from the US. When combined with Ukraine's own spending, this amounts to around 91% of Russia's military expenditure.\n\nMilitary expenditure in the Middle East rose by 9% to reach $200 billion in 2023, marking the highest annual growth rate in the region over the past decade. This increase was largely driven by Israel, which saw its military spending grow by 24% to reach $27.5 billion, following its large-scale offensive in Gaza after the October attack by Hamas. Iran also ranked as the fourth largest military spender in the Middle East, with an expenditure of $10.3 billion in 2023. Diego Lopes da Silva, a senior researcher with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), noted that the surge in military spending reflects the rapidly changing dynamics in the region, from improving diplomatic relations to fears of a broader conflict.\n\nThe United States remains the world's largest military spender. In 2023, the US raised its military budget by 2.3%, bringing total spending to $916 billion. Meanwhile, China, the second-largest military spender, allocated approximately $296 billion to its defense efforts, reflecting a 6% increase from the previous year.\n\nREAD ALSO: 30 Least Peaceful Countries in the World and 20 Countries with the Best Economy in the World in 2024.\n\nGrowing Budgets: A Win for Defense Contractors\n\nThe increase in military spending signals a growing demand for military equipment, new weapons systems, advanced technologies, and modernization efforts. This trend can lead to increased revenues and growth for companies in the defense sector, as governments seek to enhance their military capabilities in response to global security challenges.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is one of the largest companies in the defense and technologies industry. In April, the corporation was awarded a significant $17 billion contract by the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to develop the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI), which aims to enhance the country's missile defense capabilities. As the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) will create a modern, reliable, and technically advanced interceptor designed to protect the US from long-range ballistic missile threats posed by rogue nations like North Korea and Iran. This contract is part of a modernization effort for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, which includes a network of radars and interceptors. The first NGI interceptor is expected to be operational by 2028, marking a crucial advancement in national security efforts.\n\nLMT has shown impressive performance in 2024, driven by strong demand for its defense technology solutions and a backlog of nearly $160 billion, more than double its annual revenue. In the second quarter, the company reported a 9% year-over-year increase in sales, reaching over $18 billion. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $7.11, surpassing expectations by $0.66. As of October 3, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) has seen its stock price increase by 35% over the past 6 months.\n\nThe company has also demonstrated a commitment to shareholder value through consistent dividend increases and aggressive share buybacks. On October 2, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) announced a fourth-quarter dividend of $3.30 per share, marking a $0.15 increase from the previous quarter and the company's 22nd consecutive year of dividend growth. Additionally, the board authorized an increase of up to $3 billion for its share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization for future buybacks to approximately $10 billion.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of LMT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We utilized two key metrics: population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Economic strength and population numbers are effective metrics for assessing a state's overall power as they provide insights into economic capacity and human resources. While military strength is often considered when discussing state power, our focus on population and GDP allows for a broader understanding of how states can leverage their workforce potential and economic capabilities to assert influence. Population reflects the potential workforce and market size, while GDP indicates economic strength and resource availability, both of which are essential for assessing a state's overall power.\n\nWe gathered data from the United States Census Bureau, which provided us with estimated populations of US states as of July 2023. Additionally, we consulted the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which provided us with the GDP data for each state in 2023. We then ranked each state based on both population and real GDP. Subsequently, we calculated the average ranking of these two metrics and assigned a score to each state, which helped us identify the most powerful states in the US.\n\nA lower Insider Monkey Score indicates a better overall ranking in terms of GDP and population. In the case where multiple states had the same score, we used GDP as a tie-breaker. The 20 most powerful states in the US are listed below in ascending order.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT announced that its board of directors approved a 4.8% hike in its quarterly dividend to $3.30 per share, marking the 22nd consecutive annual dividend hike. The revised quarterly dividend is payable on Dec. 27, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of the business on Dec. 2, 2024.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s new annualized dividend rate is $13.20. The current dividend yield is 2.08%, better than the Zacks S&P 500 composite\u2019s 1.24%.\r\n\r\nAlong with dividend payments, Lockheed\u2019s management continues to increase shareholder value by repurchasing shares. The board authorized an additional $3 billion for share repurchases, which resulted in a total authorization under the repurchase program of nearly $10 billion.\n\nCan Lockheed Sustain Dividend Hikes?\n\nLockheed has a platform-centric focus and leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs of the U.S. Department of Defense that guarantee a steady inflow of follow-on orders. The company continues to clinch big defense deals from the U.S. government and allied countries. As a consequence, it exited the second quarter of 2024 with a record backlog of $158.3 billion, backed by increasing demand and a rising global defense budget. This shall boost LMT\u2019s sales growth and cash flow in the coming quarters.\r\n\r\nApart from domestic orders, the company also enjoys the advantage of having a wide international customer base. In the second quarter of 2024, 25.8% of total net sales were from international customers. The company is focused on expanding its international footprint, which continues to support earnings.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The F-35 program continues to be a key growth program for Lockheed. The production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for many years ahead, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy. This will support its top line and boost its earnings.\r\n\r\nCourtesy of Lockheed\u2019s global presence, strong backlog, F-35 program and contract wins, the company continues to generate strong operating cash flow, which provides assurance that it will be able to sustain shareholder-friendly moves in the future as well.\n\nOther Aerospace Companies\u2019 Recent Dividend Hikes\n\nHere are some defense companies that have been rewarding shareholders with impressive dividend payouts.\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 2024, Northrop Grumman Corp.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has gained 2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.40 per share, indicating a change of -5.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -4.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.87 indicates a change of +9% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Lockheed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.45 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $71.14 billion and $73.99 billion estimates indicate +5.3% and +4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $18.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.6%. EPS of $7.11 for the same period compares with $6.73 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.12 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.88%. The EPS surprise was +10.23%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Boeing-Lockheed Venture Launches New Rocket in Key Test",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- United Launch Alliance\u2019s new Vulcan rocket blasted off to space on Friday, a critical test of the Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. joint venture\u2019s ability to loft spy satellites for the US government.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Corner Store Comeback NYC Schools Reverse Course on Cell-Phone Ban After Parents Balk Roofs of Mexico City\u2019s Massive Food Market Will Power Public Buses Mexico City Restricts Airbnb Rentals to Curb \u2018Gentrification\u2019 A Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda\u2019s Capital City\n\nVulcan thundered off the launchpad at 7:25 a.m. local time from Cape Canaveral, Florida, nine months after the vehicle made its debut launch. The flight lasted roughly 30 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s a critical time for ULA, which is a key launch provider for the US government. The Pentagon has been putting pressure on the company and levying fines over delays with Vulcan, which is five years behind schedule. And as SpaceX\u2019s primary competitor, a successful launch of Vulcan would help pave the way for ULA to compete for more lucrative contracts and jump-start its commercial business.\n\nNo customer satellites were on board this mission. Instead, ULA launched carrying a dummy satellite \u2014 with some technical experiments embedded inside \u2014 to simulate the weight of a spacecraft.\n\nULA made the decision to fly the dummy payload in order to get off the launchpad sooner rather than later. It made the swap due to delays with its original cargo, Sierra Space\u2019s Dream Chaser plane.\n\nSubscribe Now: Business of Space newsletter, a weekly look at the inside stories of investments beyond Earth.\n\nULA\u2019s been in a hurry to fly Vulcan as the company is under contract to launch more than two dozen Space Force missions with the new rocket. Because the rocket is a new vehicle, the military required ULA to launch two flights to certify it was capable of handling the government\u2019s most sensitive spacecraft.\n\nThe flight happened as Boeing, which is burning cash as it navigates a worker strike, and Lockheed explore the sale of ULA \u2014 most recently during talks with Sierra Space.\n\nGoing into Friday\u2019s flight, ULA Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno was confident about Vulcan\u2019s chances of getting certified for Space Force missions given how well the rocket performed during its January debut.\n\n\u201cIt was the cleanest first launch I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Bruno told reporters ahead of the flight.\n\nULA is gearing up for a busy end of the year \u2014 and an even busier 2025. The company hopes to launch two Space Force missions with Vulcan before the new year. And next year, the company plans to fly as many as 20 launches \u2014 a mixture of flights using Vulcan and the company\u2019s retiring Atlas V.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso on the docket for next year are the first launches for Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Project Kuiper, the internet-from-space initiative set to rival SpaceX\u2019s Starlink. Originally, Amazon had planned to launch its first satellites for the project on ULA\u2019s Atlas V rocket by the end of this year. But Bruno said the first launches will now take place early next year, as ULA needed to prioritize its launches for the US government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because of the national security space missions that are urgent, that Amazon is supportive of,\u201d Bruno said.\n\nBruno also said ULA would find time in 2025 to fly Sierra Space\u2019s Dream Chaser, but did not specify when that might take place.\n\n(Updates with mission completion in second paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAdam Neumann\u2019s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor How Bogg Bags, the Crocs of Totes, Won Over America\u2019s Moms Rotting Rice in India Fuels Discontent About Modi\u2019s Food Policy Elon Musk\u2019s Role in Reanimating the Far-Right Term \u2018Remigration\u2019 The Great \u20ac3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Buy 5 High ROE Stocks as Middle East Tensions Spark Oil Crisis",
        "content": "Just when it appeared that the broader U.S. equity markets were cruising on a smooth sail buoyed by a solid economy, the escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have doused investor enthusiasm. Stocks tumbled across the board as Iran fired ballistic missiles at Israel to avenge the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and an Iranian commander in Lebanon. \u00a0\r\n\r\nWith Israel launching a counter-offensive strike against Lebanon, markets remained on the tenterhooks as the energy crisis began to soar. Crude oil prices have surged on the market uncertainty as traders brace for more volatility slugfest.\r\n\r\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of \u201cbacking and filling\u201d in the market, they can benefit from \u201ccash cow\u201d stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF, Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM and Banco de Chile BCH are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nWhy ROE?\n\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders\u2019 Equity\r\n\r\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry \u2014 the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management\u2019s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nParameters Used for Screening\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.\r\n\r\nPrice/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.\r\n\r\nReturn on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.\r\n\r\n5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength. \r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nHere are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin: Based in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world.
