        "title": "Northrop (NOC) Secures a Contract to Aid E-2D Hawkeye Jet Program",
        "content": "Northrop Grumman Corp.\u2019s NOC business segment, Northrop Grumman Systems, recently clinched a contract involving its E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. The award has been provided by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $41 million, the contract is projected to be completed by July 2030. Per the terms of the deal, Northrop will procure four E-2D rotodome spares to enhance the E-2D advance capabilities used on the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye jets.\n\nWork related to this deal will be executed in Melbourne, FL.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Northrop?\n\nIn this era of modern warfare, military jets play a crucial role in strengthening a nation\u2019s defense arsenal. Impressively, today\u2019s combat jets boast the capability to serve multiple missions, including air-to-air combat, air-to-ground attacks, maritime operations and even nuclear delivery. Therefore, as increasing geopolitical threats are prompting nations across the globe to reinforce their military capabilities, combat aircraft are witnessing a solid demand. This, in turn, has been ushering in frequent order flows for major combat aircraft manufacturers like Northrop. The latest contract win is a testament to that.\n\nNotably, Northrop\u2019s E-2D Hawkeye aircraft boasts battle management, theater air, missile defense and multiple sensor fusion capabilities in an airborne system. These provide the warfighter with expanded battlespace awareness, especially in the area of information operations.\n\nThe E-2D Hawkeye aircraft comes with some remarkable developments like the True 360-degree radar coverage, which provides uncompromised all-weather tracking and situational awareness. Moreover, the Advanced Hawkeye aircraft provides critical, actionable data to joint forces and first responders by utilizing the aircraft\u2019s robust network-enabled capability.\n\nSuch features make the E-2D Hawkeye aircraft an attractive choice for the military, resulting in NOC winning multiple orders for the same, like the latest one. Such orders are likely to boost Northrop\u2019s revenue generation prospects in the military aircraft business arena.\n\nNOC\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nFactors like increasing defense spending by developed nations, rising defense investment from emerging economies, rapidly rising geopolitical tensions worldwide like the ongoing hostility in the Middle East, and the rising incorporation of technology to elevate both the quality and efficiency of the new-age military jets have been bolstering the growth prospects of the combat jet market.\n\nThis must have prompted the Morder Intelligence firm to project a CAGR of 3.7% for the global fighter aircraft market in the 2024-2029 period. Such growth prospects should benefit Northrop, as its product portfolio offers a wide range of manned and unmanned aircraft that already enjoys an established position in the military aviation market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the 1930s, the company has been offering varied manned aircraft solutions to global customers worldwide. These solutions range from fighter jets and stealth bombers to surveillance and electronic warfare. Notably, apart from E-2D, NOC builds the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber jet, which is the only long-range penetrating stealth bomber in the U.S. arsenal.\n\nOpportunities for Peers\n\nThe abounding growth prospects of the global fighter market should also benefit other prominent defense majors like Lockheed Martin LMT, Boeing BA and Textron TXT that manufacture combat jets.\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s Aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jet, the C-130 Hercules airlifter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon jet and the F-22 Raptor jet.\n\nLMT\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 4.1%. Shares of LMT have returned 3.8% to its investors in the past year.\n\nBoeing\u2019s Defense, Space & Security segment\u2019s primary products include fixed-wing military aircraft, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. The segment also manufactures rotorcraft and rotary-wing programs, such as CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache and V-22 Osprey.\n\nBoeing\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 25.5%. The stock boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 17.83%.\n\nTextron\u2019s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally known military aircraft preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron\u2019s renowned products include the Beechcraft T-6C trainer and the AT-6 Wolverine.\n\nThe company boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates growth of 5.7% from the previous year\u2019s reported number.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past six months, shares of Northrop have lost 6.5% compared with the industry\u2019s 9% decline.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks That Could Make Your Grandchildren Rich",
        "content": "If building multi-generational wealth is one of your investment objectives, you may consider buying growth stocks for the long-term portfolio. Multi-generational wealth may sound like something you need a large amount at the start to build, but with long-term compounding, you can snowball a relatively small initial investment into a small fortune.\n\nWhat makes long-term growth stocks such a strong choice for this strategy? It all has to do with the twofold way such stocks have the potential to produce above-average annualized total returns over a long time frame.\n\nThat is, high-quality long-term growth stocks can steadily appreciate in value over time in line with earnings growth. Some of these stocks can even make gains that outpace earnings growth if the market decides to \u201creward\u201d them with a re-rating to a higher valuation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlongside price appreciation, these stocks typically have consistent dividends that increase over time. If reinvested back into the stock, these dividends can further boost overall returns.\n\nThe following seven stocks stand out as names that could be winning growth stocks for the long-term investor.\n\nAmerican Water Works (AWK) A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.\n\nSource: HQuality/ShutterStock.com\n\nBased in Camden, New Jersey, American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is a water utility holding company. Across the U.S., American Water Works provides water and wastewater services to over 3.5 million customers in 14 states. While this may not sound like a dynamic, cutting-edge industry, I wouldn\u2019t knock the growth potential of owning a water utility stock.\n\nAccording to sell-side earnings forecasts, the company is expected to report high single-digit earnings growth over the next few years. Such growth is likely sufficient for AWK stock to sustain its current valuation of 24.9 times forward earnings. Along with the possibility of steady price appreciation, AWK has a 2.3% dividend yield. Not only that, payouts have grown by an average of 9.14% annually for the past five years.\n\nWith 15 years of consecutive dividend growth under its belt, American Water Works is a decade away from gaining \u201cDividend Aristocrat\u201d status. AWK isn\u2019t going to make you a fortune quickly, but over decades, an investment in the stock could compound into a sizable nest egg for your grandchildren.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) whose reputation as one of the top growth stocks for the long term precedes it. That is, shares in the wholesale club operator have a very strong track record in price appreciation over many years. Over the past five years, shares have surged by more than threefold.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the last decade, COST stock is up a staggering 732%. Yes, with its sterling reputation, buying COST today will be costly, and not just because each individual share costs around $850. At current prices, Costco Wholesale trades for 53 times forward earnings. If so pricey, why is it still worthy of a long-term buy? As Seeking Alpha contributor Noah\u2019s Arc Capital Management recently argued, various factors suggest that COST can sustain its valuation and continue to gain.\n\nThese factors include the discount retailer\u2019s unique business model, namely its subscription-based revenue stream, its high return on common equity, and the prospect of further new store growth via international expansion. COST has a relatively small 0.5% dividend, but payouts have increased 19 years in a row, with the latest dividend hike coming in at 13.7%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), best known as the parent company of Google and YouTube, may be your best choice out of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d regarding long-term growth potential. At least when one weighs the tech giant\u2019s growth prospects against its current valuation.\n\nRight now, GOOG stock trades for around 25 times forward earnings. This puts it at the low end of valuations for Magnificent 7 stocks. Yet as Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff recently pointed out, despite concerns about Google\u2019s search business under threat by AI-related disruption, these worries may be overblown. Moreover, other factors, like the continued growth of Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud segment, provide further credence to forecasts calling for GOOG\u2019s earnings to continue growing in the 15% range.\n\nTo top things off, Alphabet has started to pay a dividend. While very tiny today, this 20-cent per share payout could grow substantially over time, especially as GOOG\u2019s annual earnings could hit the $10 per share mark by 2026. Other Magnificent 7 stocks could outperform in the near term, but if you\u2019re looking for a mega-cap tech stock offering the strongest chances of staying power, GOOG stands out as your best choice.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is another name commonly cited as one of the top growth stocks for the long-term investor. The defense contractor\u2019s dividend growth policy one key reason behind this long-term growth reputation. For the past 21 years, Lockheed Martin increased its dividend on an annual basis.\n\nAt current prices, LMT stock sports a 2.7% forward yield. Payouts have increased by an average of 7.7% over the past five years. Alongside steady, growing payouts, however, is the potential for more-than-satisfactory returns via price appreciation. The current geopolitical climate leaves top defense firms like Lockheed Martin poised to benefit from increased defense spending by the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAs Barrons\u2019 Al Root recently pointed out, U.S. defense spending has increased by 6% annually over the past five years, and global defense spending has accelerated since 2016. If that\u2019s not encouraging enough, Lockheed Martin\u2019s backlog is large enough to mitigate the remote possibility of near-term defense spending cuts. Besides rising in value in line with earnings growth, increased confidence that elevated growth is here to stay could lead to multiple expansions for LMT. Shares currently trade for only 17.8 times forward earnings.\n\nPaychex (PAYX) The Paychex (PAYX) sign on the side of the company's building in Mirimar, Florida.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors soured on Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) recently, but shares in the payroll processor and outsourced human resources services provider could prove to be a solid growth name to buy and hold for the long haul. PAYX recently tumbled after earnings, as uncertainty about the challenges small and medium-sized businesses face countered key positives with the earnings release.\n\nHowever, despite the pessimism, Paychex operates in a fairly resilient industry. In time, macro issues like inflation can ease, leading to a stronger environment for Paychex to thrive. Forecasts call for consistent mid-to-high single-digit earnings growth in the coming years. Dividend growth potential is also very promising with PAYX stock. In fact, back in May, I pointed out how Paychex may be one of the best dividend stocks out there.\n\nPAYX currently has a forward dividend yield of 3.3%. For nine years in a row, PAYX increased its rate of payout. Payouts have increased by an average of 9.7% annually over the past five years. The company\u2019s latest 10% dividend increase was in line with the level of dividend growth seen in recent years.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) delivered strong growth over the past decade, but shares in the steakhouse chain have been on a tear this year. Year-to-date, the stock is up by around 42%. With such a big run-up, you may initially think that shares have gotten ahead of themselves.\n\nYet while there may be potential for a correction or sell-off in the near term, TXRH stock still stands to be one of the best growth stocks for the long term. Headwinds like cost pressures are easing, the company is still reported strong levels of same-store sales growth. Best of all, the chain continues to open new locations, with 30 expected to openthis year.\n\nAll of this points to further double-digit earnings growth, which in turn translates into additional price appreciation and the high likelihood of continued high dividend increases. Shares yield 1.4% today, and payouts have grown by an average of 17.2% annually over the past five years. While pricey at 29 times forward earnings, a continued growth streak could outweigh this, resulting in strong total returns in the years to come.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) has only been a public company for one generation, but during this time shares have delivered strong returns for investors, through both capital growth and dividends. For the generations ahead, this tradition may continue, thanks to a secular growth trend: the digitization of payments.\n\nAs you likely know, Visa and its rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) effectively have a global payments duopoly. What was previously cash-based transactions continues to shift to card/digital-based transactions, enabling Visa to sustain solid revenue and earnings growth, most recently seen in the company\u2019s last quarterly earnings release. As the world keeps going cashless, expect this trend to continue.\n\nSince going public in 2008, Visa has increased its dividend. Over the past five years, Visa\u2019s payouts have grown by an average of 15.% annually. The latest quarterly dividend hike, from 45 cents to 52 cents, represented annual dividend growth of around 15.6%. The current cash dividend with V stock may seem low at 0.8%. However, as time passes, these payouts will play an even more significant role in producing long-term total returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Want Decades of Passive Income? 2 Top Dividend Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever.",
        "content": "There's something quite pleasant about having cash deposited into your investment account quarter after quarter and year after year. Here are two outstanding dividend stocks with long histories of rewarding their shareholders with steadily rising cash payments. Both stocks can help you build your own streams of passive income.\n\nTop dividend stock No. 1: Lockheed Martin\n\nLockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) helps the U.S. government and its allies protect their citizens from a growing number of threats. The company is a vital ally in an increasingly volatile world.\n\nAs a leading defense contractor, Lockheed supplies crucial technology to the U.S. military. Here are just a few examples:\n\nThe F-35 stealth aircraft serves a crucial role in the security strategies of the Air Force, Navy, and Marines, as well as that of 18 allied nations. The Aegis radar system is helping U.S. forces protect merchant shipping vessels from drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea. Patriot-launched PAC-3 interceptors are enabling Ukraine to fend off Russia's aerial bombardments. An F-35 aircraft takes to the skies. Image source: Lockheed Martin.\n\nLockheed has amassed $159 billion worth of orders for its broad array of defensive platforms. Combined with the long service lives of its key products -- the F-35, for one, is expected to remain in service until at least 2080 -- this massive backlog gives investors a high degree of visibility into the company's future cash flow.\n\nManagement is committed to passing much of this cash on to shareholders via stock buybacks and a steadily rising dividend. Over the past decade, Lockheed has bought back a quarter of its shares, which has boosted per-share profits for its remaining stockholders. The defense leader has also raised its cash payout for 21 straight years. Today, Lockheed's dividend yield is a solid 2.7%.\n\nTop dividend stock No. 2: Eli Lilly\n\nFor more than 140 years, Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY) has used cutting-edge science to help people live better. The healthcare leader's history is chock-full of medical breakthroughs, but its latest discovery could be the most impactful and profitable one yet.\n\nAlmost 70% of American adults are obese or overweight, which can lead to life-threatening illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, and strokes. Fortunately, Eli Lilly has developed a game-changing drug that makes it easier for people to lose weight.\n\nZepbound, the pharmaceutical pioneer's weight-management treatment for adults, activates hormone receptors that reduce appetite. Participants in a 72-week clinical trial who received the highest dose of the drug lost 48 pounds on average.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen combined with diet and exercise, Zepbound also helped these people improve their cholesterol and blood pressure profiles. And tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, can make it easier for adults with type 2 diabetes to control their blood sugar levels. Better still, recent studies suggest that tirzepatide could have positive effects for people with liver disease and sleep apnea.\n\nDue to tirzepatide's many potential health benefits, CEO Dave Ricks believes it will be the most important medicine of his 28-year career. Wall Street seems to agree. Investment bank Goldman Sachs expects Eli Lilly to be a leader in an anti-obesity drug market that will soar to $130 billion by the end of the decade. The company's profits, in turn, are projected to increase by more than 60% annually over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lockheed Martin wasn\u2019t one of them.
