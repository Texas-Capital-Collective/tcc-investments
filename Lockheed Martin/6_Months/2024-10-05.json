It measures the overbought and oversold levels on a scale from 0 to 100. A reading above -20 is overbought and a reading below -80 is oversold.\n\nGolden used a 28-month parameter, an industry standard for this indicator.\n\nLooking deeper into the list of overbought stocks brings an interesting mix of domestic and foreign catalysts.\n\nLockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) presence on this list is unsurprising. The leading aerospace and defense manufacturer\u2019s stock hit a fresh all-time high, reaching $609 and giving it a market cap of over $144B. The firm benefits from increased defense spending during escalating global conflicts and with a new multi-billion U.S. Navy contract it landed last Thursday. Despite a hefty $19.26B debt, the firm has the balance sheet to easily manage it, plus pay a reliable 2.1% dividend. Its Williams %R overbought score is currently -11.41.\n\nTrending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

It recently hit a new all-time high of $274.16. Along with other home improvement stocks, Lowe experienced a surge following the FED's rate cut. Still, this strong performance is surprising, given the firm's revenue decline of nearly 10% year over year and dimmed future growth projections. Its Williams %R overbought score is currently -5.71.\n\nEntergy Corp (NYSE:ETR) has been a utility industry standout, delivering an almost 30% return year-to-date. Despite such numbers, the stock trades at a reasonable P/E ratio of 15.9x, below some of its peers like Exelon or FirstEnergy.\n\nEntergy provides electric power to the southern U.S. states, benefiting from rapid energy growth in states such as Texas. Investors expect the company to scale with its target market, with a booming population and increased industrial activity prompting higher energy consumption. The stock's Williams %R overbought score currently stands at -7.41.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today.
