        "title": "Should Lockheed Stock Be in Your Portfolio Ahead of Q3 Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT is slated to release third-quarter 2024 results on Oct. 22, before the opening bell.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $17.28 billion, implying 2.4% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. The consensus mark for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $6.43 per share, suggesting a 5% decline from $6.77 reported in the prior-year quarter. The bottom-line estimate has inched up 0.5% in the past 60 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLMT, America\u2019s largest defense contractor, has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.46%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Whisper for LMT\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lockheed this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nLockheed has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.46%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors Shaping LMT\u2019s Upcoming Q3 Results\n\nA potential solid sales improvement from each of LMT\u2019s four business segments is likely to have bolstered the company\u2019s top-line performance.\n\nAeronautics to Post Solid Sales\n\nThe Aeronautics segment, which primarily manufactures advanced, combat-proven jets, and contributes almost 40% to the company\u2019s top line, is likely to deliver impressive third-quarter results.\n\nA ramp-up in the production of the F-16 program, along with higher sales volume from production and sustainment contracts for the F-35 program, is likely to have bolstered this segment\u2019s top line.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aeronautics unit\u2019s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $6,764.8 million, indicating a 0.7% rise from the prior-year period\u2019s reported figure.\n\nImpressive Projections From Other Segments\n\nThe remaining three segments are also projected to have performed favorably in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nHigher sales volume from the hypersonic development programs, along with Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), transport layer and other space exploration programs must have boosted the Space segment\u2019s top line.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment\u2019s revenues is pinned at $3,174 million, indicating a 2.3% improvement from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported number.\n\nLMT\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control (\u201cMFC\u201d) segment provides critical missile defense support to the United States and foreign allies. A higher sales volume, resulting from the production ramp-up of the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile programs, is likely to have benefited this unit\u2019s quarterly sales performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MFC\u2019s third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $3,116.7 million, indicating 6% growth from the top line recorded a year ago.\n\nHigher sales volume from the Sikorsky unit, particularly driven by CH-53K and Blackhawk helicopters, is likely to have bolstered the Rotary and Mission Systems (\u201cRMS\u201d) segment\u2019s sales in the quarter under review.\n\nThe solid production ramp-up of this unit\u2019s laser systems portfolio and higher sales volume of radar might have also contributed favorably to RMS\u2019 third-quarter top line.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the unit\u2019s revenues is currently pegged at $4,203.1 million, indicating a 2% improvement from the top line registered a year ago.\n\nOutlook for LMT\u2019s Q3 Bottom-Line\n\nHigher interest expenses remain a headwind for the majority of U.S. companies, with Lockheed being no exception. With the Federal Reserve having cut the nation\u2019s interest rate in the second half of September, notable interest expenses can be expected to have weighed on LMT\u2019s third-quarter earnings.\n\nOur model estimate for third-quarter interest expenses is $249.8 million, reflecting a solid 5.4% increase year over year.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, LMT recognized a reach-forward loss of $100 million associated with a classified missile program at its MFC unit. This, in turn, adversely impacted this unit\u2019s operating profit in the second quarter as well. With a potential loss of $350 million associated with this program, LMT might have also incurred a notable loss in its MFC unit in the third quarter. This, in turn, is likely to have adversely impacted its margin performance and, thereby, bottom-line growth.\n\nAlso, the unfavorable cost pressure faced by its Sikorsky business might have had affected LMT\u2019s overall earnings performance in the third quarter, outweighing the favorable impacts of solid top-line growth.\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nLockheed\u2019s shares have exhibited an upward trend, gaining a notable percentage over the year-to-date period. Specifically, the stock has risen 33.5% year to date, outperforming the Zacks aerospace-defense industry\u2019s decline of 7.3%.\n\nYTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs evident from the image, other notable stocks from the same industry have also rallied year to date and comfortably outpaced the industry\u2019s performance. Shares of L3Harris Technologies LHX, General Dynamics GD and Textron TXT have rallied 16.5%, 15.6% and 9.3%, respectively.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, LMT is trading at a premium when compared to its industry. Currently, LMT is trading at 21.39X forward 12-month earnings, which is higher than the industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple of 19.29. Also, its five-year median is 15.82X. So, the company\u2019s valuation also looks stretched compared with its own range.\n\nLMT\u2019s Price-to-Earnings (forward 12 Months) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nWidespread hostilities engulfing the global defense map in recent times have prompted nations worldwide to ramp up their defense arsenal significantly. This has been acting as a solid growth catalyst for defense contractors like Lockheed in the form of solid contract wins. We may thus expect LMT\u2019s third-quarter results to duly reflect this in terms of notable revenue growth.\n\nBacked by its solid top-line prospects, the company has been offering notable rewards to its shareholders. Impressively, LMT\u2019s dividend yield of 2.08% outpaces that of the S&P 500 (1.22%).\n\nHowever, persistently high interest expenses remain a major headwind for the company\u2019s near-term bottom-line growth. These might have also contributed to LMT\u2019s elevated leverage, as evident from its long-term debt-to-capital ratio, which came in quite higher than that of its peer group.\n\nLMT\u2019s Long-Term Debt-to-Capital Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShould You Buy LMT Stock Before Q3 Earnings Release?\n\nLockheed is less likely to disappoint with its third-quarter results, considering the recent upward revision in its earnings estimates, favorable Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP. However, considering its premium valuation and elevated leverage, investors interested in this stock should wait until next Tuesday.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Analysts Estimate Boeing (BA) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for",
        "content": "Boeing (BA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 23, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis airplane builder is expected to post quarterly loss of $4.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -48.8%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $17.98 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 592.72% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Boeing?\n\nFor Boeing, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -60.48%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Boeing will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Boeing would post a loss of $1.79 per share when it actually produced a loss of $2.90, delivering a surprise of -62.01%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nBoeing doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, Lockheed Martin (LMT) is soon expected to post earnings of $6.43 per share for the quarter ended September 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $17.28 billion, up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Lockheed has been revised 0.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.46%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Returns On Capital At Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Have Hit The Brakes",
        "content": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Lockheed Martin is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.24 = US$8.9b \u00f7 (US$55b - US$18b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nThus, Lockheed Martin has an ROCE of 24%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Lockheed Martin compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for Lockheed Martin .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nThere hasn't been much to report for Lockheed Martin's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. Although current returns are high, we'd need more evidence of underlying growth for it to look like a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Lockheed Martin is paying out 46% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough is allocating it's capital efficiently to generate impressive returns, it isn't compounding its base of capital, which is what we'd see from a multi-bagger. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 85% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne more thing to note, we've identified  2 warning signs  with Lockheed Martin and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our freelist of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +6.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Lockheed belongs, has lost 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nLockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.43 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $26.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -4.9%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.77 indicates a change of +8.7% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.28 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $71.06 billion and $74.02 billion estimates indicate +5.2% and +4.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nLockheed reported revenues of $18.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.6%. EPS of $7.11 for the same period compares with $6.73 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.12 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.88%. The EPS surprise was +10.23%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nLockheed is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
