        "content": "The third-quarter earnings season is well under way, with companies across a range of sectors due to report in the coming week.\n\nTesla is set to take centre stage next week, as investors await the latest set of results from Elon Musk's EV company, on the back of its recent robotaxi event.\n\nIn the world of finance, the focus so far this earnings season has been on the major US banks, but it is now the turn of UK giants Lloyds, Barclays and NatWest to report in the coming week.\n\nMeanwhile, French cosmetics company L'Or\u00e9al is set to release its third-quarter sales figures.\n\nInvestors will also be looking to see if momentum from Coca-Cola's strong second quarter has carried on into its latest set of results.\n\nConsumer goods company Unilever will also be in focus, as investors keep an eye out for further progress on the business' growth action plan.\n\nHere's more on what to look out for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Wednesday 23 October\n\nShares in Tesla slumped after its recent robotaxi event, in which the electric carmaker revealed its fully autonomous \"Cybercab\", as well as unveiling its \"Robovan\" concept.\n\nA lack of details surrounding the rollout plan and regulatory approval, plus no mention of a more affordable regular EV, left Wall Street wanting more. This most recently volatility in the stock, has left shares down nearly 11% year-to-date.\n\nIn fact, AJ Bell's Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth point out that Tesla is the only one of the \"Magnificent Seven\", which includes tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), to have seen such declines over the past year.\n\nRead more: The best stocks to buy in the UK, according to Barclays\n\n\"Indeed, the shares are down by almost 50% from their 2021 peak, despite ongoing investor enthusiasm for electric vehicles and autonomous driving and \u2014 more specifically to Tesla \u2014 the Cybertruck, Cybercab and the roll out of its supercharger network,\" they said.\n\nThat said, recently released figures showed that Tesla's deliveries were up 6% for the third quarter. AJ Bell's investment experts noted that this \"understandably led analysts to expect better again for the third quarter\" results more broadly.\n\nThey said analysts were expecting sales to come in at $25.5bn (\u00a319.5bn) for the third quarter, which would be 9% higher than a year ago.\n\nAnalysts are also said to be expecting to see further improvement in earnings per share (EPS) of $0.57 in the third-quarter, which would mean a return to year-on-year growth. Tesla's EPS of $0.47 in the second quarter missed expectations and was below the $0.78 it generated for the same period in the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nLloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Wednesday 23 October\n\nThree big UK banks are set to report this week, with Lloyds kicking things off on Wednesday, followed by Barclays (BARC.L) on Thursday and NatWest (NWG.L) on Friday.\n\n\"The banking sector has shown good performance in the past year, despite the shallow recession in the UK in the second half of 2023,\" said AJ Bell's Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth.\n\nAcross those three banks alone, they said that stated pre-tax profit is expected to be generally flat in 2024 and 2025, at around \u00a320bn.\n\nRead more: Interest rate cut in November near certain after inflation drops\n\n\"Thanks to the combination of competition, interest rate cuts from the Bank of England and political and public pressure, net interest margins and net interest income look to have peaked and that is a key reason why analysts think the banks may struggle to grow earnings substantially from here onwards,\" they said.\n\nLooking at Lloyds specifically, the consensus estimate on its headline pre-tax income for the third quarter is \u00a31.6bn, versus \u00a31.9bn for the same period last year.\n\nIn the second quarter, the bank delivered pre-tax profit of \u00a31.7bn, which was higher than the \u00a31.6bn it generated in Q2 2023 and beat market expectations of \u00a31.58bn.\n\nIn terms of dividends, Lloyds is forecast to pay just over 3p a share, which added to its declared \u00a32bn buyback programme, gives a total cash return of \u00a33.9bn for 2024.\n\nYear-to-date Lloyds Banking Group shares are up 29%.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al (OR.PA) \u2014 Reports quarterly sales figures on Tuesday 22 October\n\nThe world's largest cosmetic's company, L'Or\u00e9al is set to report after the market close on Tuesday.\n\nShares have been under pressure this year, down more than 17% year-to-date, with it seeing further declines after the release of half-year results at the end of July.\n\nWhile L'Or\u00e9al reported that like-for-like sales had risen 7.3% to \u20ac22.1bn (\u00a318.4bn) in the first half, the company noted \"depressed beauty demand in China\" amid its economic slowdown.\n\nIn terms of its third quarter, Barclays' equity research team said in a note released on Friday that it was looking for organic sales growth of upwards of 6.2%.\n\nRead more: How to minimise a capital gains tax impact on your investments\n\nBarclays' team said the focus would be on the US consumer in these results and highlighted that growth in its fragrance business \"remains strong and continues to outperform other categories with some share gains for L'Or\u00e9al\".\n\nThe team said they had hoped for a rebound in cosmetics in China in the second half of the year \"but that now seems unlikely given the current weak state of Chinese consumer confidence\".\n\nOverall, they said that L'Or\u00e9al's valuation looks \"undemanding\" relative to where it's stood historically and that \"conversations with investors suggest many are tempted to add or buy at these levels\".\n\n\"We see risks as skewed to the upside, with expectations low and any sense of sequential stabilisation likely well received,\" they added.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Wednesday 23 October\n\nShares in soft drinks company Coca-Cola hit an all-time high closing price last month of $73.01 per share, with the stock up 19% year-to-date.\n\nAarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the company's second-quarter results in July \"blew the lid off market expectations\".\n\nCoco-Cola reported net revenues were up 3% in the second quarter to $12.4bn, while organic sales grew by 15%.\n\nRead more:What UK wealth managers and investment platforms want to see in the budget\n\nThis led management to upgrade full-year guidance for the second time this year, expecting organic revenue to grow between 9% and 10% in 2024.\n\n\"When the group reports results next week, investors expect to hear that some of this momentum has spilled into the third quarter,\" Chiekrie said. \"But Coca-Cola\u2019s rolling into some tough comparable periods for growth over the second half of the year, so don\u2019t expect the same level of positive surprise as in the first half.\"\n\nHe added: \"Cash generation remains very healthy, providing scope for increased share buybacks and potentially even new acquisitions in the near to medium term.\u201d\n\nUnilever (ULVR.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Thursday 24 October\n\nConsumer goods giant Unilever has been trading close to five-year highs, point out AJ Bell's investment experts, as investors \"respond favourably to chief executive Hein Schumacher\u2019s growth action plan\".\n\nThe plan, launched in March, will see the group spin off its ice cream business, cut \u20ac800m in costs \u2014 which includes 7,500 redundancies \u2014 and invest heavily in its thirty \"power brands\".\n\nUnliever's group underlying sales are forecast to have risen by 4.2% in the third quarter, up slightly from 3.9% in Q2. Meanwhile, stated revenues are forecast to have risen by 1.5% to \u20ac15.5bn.\n\nAJ Bell's Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth point out that Unilever\u2019s \"long-term target range for sales growth is 3% to 5% a year and current guidance from Mr Schumacher is for underlying sales growth to come within that range in 2024 overall\".\n\nRead more: European Central Bank cuts interest rates for the third time this year\n\nWhile they said that Unliever may not offer too much detail on profits, analysts will look for any comment on its underlying operating margin for the year, which it had said was expected to exceed 18% versus 16.7% last year.\n\n\"Analysts will also look for an update on the planned demerger of the ice cream business, which is due to occur by the end of 2025, especially with regard to whether the company will list its shares in London or Amsterdam,\" they said.\n\nIn addition, AJ Bell's investment experts said that shareholders will be keeping an eye out any further hints of wider merger and acquisition activity, \"given Mr Schumacher\u2019s plan to make selective purchases and also prune the range of brands by means of disposals.\"\n\nOther companies reporting this week include:\n\nMonday 21 October\n\nTristel (TSTL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP.DE)\n\nSandvik (SAND.ST)\n\nTuesday 22 October\n\nVirgin Wine (VINO.L)\n\nInterContinental Hotels (IHG.L)\n\nGear4Music (G4M.L)\n\nChina Mobile (600941.SS)\n\nSK Hynix (000660.KS)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nLogitech (LOGN.SW)\n\nSaab (SAAB-B.ST)\n\nRandstad (RAND.AS)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nPhilip Morris International (PM)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nRTX (RTX)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nKimberly-Clark (KMB)\n\nCoStar Group (CSGP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSeagate (STX)\n\nPackaging Corp (PKG)\n\nInterpublic (IPG)\n\nWednesday 23 October\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nWPP (WPP.L)\n\nBarratt Redrow (BTRW.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nHong Kong Exchanges (0388.HK)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATCO-A.ST)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nHeineken (HEIA.AS)\n\nAssa Abloy (ASSA-B.ST)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZA.AS)\n\nDeutsche Bank (DBK.DE)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nVolvo Cars (VOLV-B.ST)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-B.ST)\n\nSaipem (SPM.MI)\n\nViscofan (VIS.MC)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nAmphenol (APH)\n\nGE Vernova (GEV)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nTeradyne (TER)\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS)\n\neBay (EBAY)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nThursday 24 October\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLondon Stock Exchange (LSEG.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nInchape (INCH.L)\n\nRenishaw (RSW.L)\n\nEssentra (ESNT.L)\n\nDunelm (DNLM.L)\n\nBloomsbury Publishing (BMY.L)\n\nLuceco (LUCE.L)\n\nCanon (7751.T)\n\nRenasas (6723.T)\n\nCNOOC (0883.HK)\n\nHyundai Motor (005380.KS)\n\nBudweiser Brewing Company (1876.HK)\n\nHerm\u00e8s (RMS.PA)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nVinci (DG.PA)\n\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes (DSY.PA)\n\nDanone (BN.PA)\n\nBeiersdorf (BEI.DE)\n\nKone (KNEBV.HE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.ST)\n\nSodexo (SW.PA)\n\nBE Semiconductor (BESI.AS)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nStora Enso (STERV.HE)\n\nUnion Pacific (UNP)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper KDP (KDP)\n\nDow (DOW)\n\nWestern Digital (WDC)\n\nHasbro (HAS)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nUS Steel (X)\n\nFriday 25 October\n\nNatWest (NWG.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nRecord (REC.L)\n\nFanuc (6954.T)\n\nICBC (601398.SS)\n\nPing An Insurance (601318.SS)\n\nGreat Wall Motor (601633.SS)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nSafran (SAF.PA)\n\nPorsche (PAH3.DE)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.DE)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nENI (ENI.MI)\n\nSika.SW (SIKA.SW)\n\nSGS (SGSN.SW)\n\nKonecranes (KCR.HE)\n\nR\u00e9my Cointreau (RCO.PA)\n\nKindred (KIND-SDB.ST)\n\nColgate-Palmolive (CL)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Defense Contractors Stocks Q2 Results: Benchmarking Mercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY)",
        "content": "Defense Contractors Stocks Q2 Results: Benchmarking Mercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY)\n\nThe end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let\u2019s take a look at how defense contractors stocks fared in Q2, starting with Mercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY).\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 15 defense contractors stocks we track reported a very strong Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 4.7% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 6.7% below.\n\nBig picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled.\n\nLuckily, defense contractors stocks have performed well with share prices up 16% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nMercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY)\n\nFounded in 1981, Mercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY) specializes in providing processing subsystems and components for primarily defense applications.\n\nMercury Systems reported revenues of $248.6 million, down 1.8% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 7.8%. Overall, it was an incredible quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 organic revenue and earnings estimates.\n\n\u201cIn fiscal 2024, we made considerable progress in addressing what we believe to be transient challenges in the business, and we enter fiscal 2025 confident in our strategic positioning as a leader in mission-critical processing at the edge and our ability to deliver predictable organic growth with expanding margins and robust free cash flow,\u201d said Bill Ballhaus, Mercury\u2019s Chairman and CEO.\n\nStory continues Mercury Systems Total Revenue\n\nMercury Systems delivered the slowest revenue growth of the whole group. Interestingly, the stock is up 2% since reporting and currently trades at $34.69.\n\nIs now the time to buy Mercury Systems?

The business had an incredible quarter with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 earnings estimates. Leonardo DRS Total Revenue\n\nLeonardo DRS achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems content with the results as the stock is up 4% since reporting. It currently trades at $29.33.\n\nIs now the time to buy Leonardo DRS?

Still, it was a slower quarter as it posted a miss of analysts\u2019 backlog sales estimates.\n\nInterestingly, the stock is up 4.5% since the results and currently trades at $307.80.\n\nRead our full analysis of General Dynamics\u2019s results here.\n\nKratos (NASDAQ:KTOS)\n\nEstablished with a commitment to supporting national security, Kratos (NASDAQ:KTOS) is a provider of advanced engineering, technology, and security solutions tailored for critical national security applications.\n\nKratos reported revenues of $300.1 million, up 16.8% year on year. This print surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations by 8.7%. Overall, it was an exceptional quarter as it also logged an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 organic revenue and earnings estimates.\n\nThe stock is up 26.8% since reporting and currently trades at $25.50.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Kratos here, it\u2019s free.\n\nRTX (NYSE:RTX)\n\nOriginally focused on refrigeration technology, Raytheon (NSYE:RTX) provides a a variety of products and services to the aerospace and defense industries.\n\nRTX reported revenues of $19.72 billion, up 7.7% year on year. This number surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.3%. It was an exceptional quarter as it also put up an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 organic revenue estimates.\n\nRTX pulled off the highest full-year guidance raise among its peers.
