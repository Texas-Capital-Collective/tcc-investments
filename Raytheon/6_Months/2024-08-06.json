This contract supports the replenishment of Patriot missiles donated by Germany to Ukraine. Showing their strong support for Ukraine, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have agreed to participate in the financing of this procurement.\n\n\"Our customers are already realizing the benefits of bundled, multi-national procurement of Patriot missiles through NSPA, including the economies that offer greater affordability and the pre-negotiated contracting framework that shortens the acquisition timeline,\" said Tom Laliberty, president of Land and Air Defense Systems at Raytheon. \"As a result, not only can we better support the missile inventories for these European partners, but also strengthen our cooperation, their interoperability, and their contribution to an essential NATO mission.\"\n\nMs Stacy A. Cummings, NSPA General Manager, confirmed: \"This contract demonstrates once again that NSPA, as NATO's lead organization for multinational acquisition, support and sustainment, delivers effective and cost-efficient multinational solutions to nations, while reinforcing European industrial capacities.
