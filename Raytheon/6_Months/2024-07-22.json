        "content": "The test fire took place at the Government's Porton Down science and defence technology campus in Wiltshire - Raytheon\n\nA high-powered laser weapon capable of shooting down aerial drones has been fired from a British military vehicle for the first time.\n\nRaytheon\u2019s high-energy laser weapon system (HELWS) was mounted on a British Army Wolfhound armoured truck for the test-fire, which took place at the Government\u2019s Porton Down science and defence technology campus in Wiltshire.\n\nIt is the first time the weapon has been trialled in the UK as part of an ongoing Ministry of Defence (MoD) programme to develop directed energy weapons.\n\nHELWS, which is already cleared for use by the US military, is designed to shoot down small drones and be compatible with existing air defence systems such as radar.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDeveloping anti-drone systems is increasingly important as low-cost weapons become more common on the battlefield. For example, Russia and Ukraine have relied heavily on drones to launch attacks on one another.\n\nBritish and American ships were recently forced to fire multimillion-pound missiles to shoot down inexpensive unmanned drones launched by Houthi rebels on the Red Sea.\n\nShooting down drones with lasers, which cost far less per shot than the drones themselves, offers a much cheaper solution.\n\nJames Gray, chief executive and managing director of Raytheon UK, said: \u201cWe have proven that the Raytheon high-energy laser weapon system can track and engage targets whilst mounted on a vehicle.\n\n\u201cThe speed at which this capability was delivered is only possible due to the hard work of our British partners, coupled with the operationally proven technology developed by Raytheon.\u201d\n\nUK-based companies including Frazer Nash, NP Aerospace, LumOptica, Blighter Surveillance Systems and Cambridge Pixel contributed technology to the project.\n\nThe test comes after the MoD demonstrated Dragonfire, another laser weapon that the Navy hopes to mount on to warships by 2027.\n\nDragonfire was developed by a consortium including MBDA, Leonardo and QinetiQ.\n\nRaytheon\u2019s HELWS is being developed in partnership with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S), which are both part of the MoD.\n\nStory continues\n\nMatt Cork, of DSTL, said: \u201cThe joint working between DSTL, DE&S and industry has enabled rapid evolution of this laser demonstrator.\n\n\u201cThe successful testing of this high-powered laser weapon marks a pivotal moment in our ongoing efforts to enhance the future operational capabilities of the British Army.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis technology offers a precise, powerful and cost-effective means to defeat aerial threats, ensuring greater protection for our forces.\u201d",

The UK\u2019s first test of a High-Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS) was successfully completed by Raytheon UK and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl)\n\nThis ground-breaking test, conducted at Dstl's range in Porton Down, saw the laser weapon fired at full power whilst integrated onto a British Army Wolfhound armoured vehicle. The lightweight, portable HELWS is the first laser weapon integrated on a land vehicle to be fired in the UK.\n\nThis milestone marks a major leap forward in the UK Ministry of Defence's Land Laser Directed Energy Weapon (LDEW) Demonstrator programme. The increasing prevalence, proliferation and evolution of drone warfare makes the rapid adoption of counter-UAS technologies ever more important.\n\nThis variant of the HELWS has been designed to defeat NATO class 1 drones whilst being easily compatible within existing air defence systems, including radar, command and control and other platforms.\n\n\"We have proven that the Raytheon high energy laser weapon system can track and engage targets whilst mounted on a vehicle,\" said James Gray, chief executive and managing director of Raytheon UK. \"The speed at which this capability was delivered is only possible due to the hard work of our British SME partners, coupled with the operationally proven technology developed by Raytheon.\"\n\nThe Wolfhound integration successfully fused the proven capability of Raytheon's High-Energy Laser Weapon System with cutting edge UK intellectual property from Frazer Nash, NP Aerospace, LumOptica, Blighter Surveillance Systems, and Cambridge Pixel.\n\n\"As Defence Secretary, I want to take the politics out of national security so where there is important work begun under the previous government, we will take it forward in the interest of national security,\"\u00a0said Secretary of State for\u00a0Defence, the Rt Hon John Healey MP. \"That is why we are renewing important partnerships with industry and continuing to push technological boundaries. This will drive prosperity and create skilled jobs across the country.\"\n\nTeam Hersa, which pairs Dstl's technical expertise with the best acquisition skills from DE&S, is managing delivery of the demonstrators and is responsible for preparing Defence for the introduction of innovative weapons systems, ensuring the UK Armed Forces can successfully exploit this potentially game changing capability at pace.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The joint working between Dstl, DE&S and industry has enabled rapid evolution of this laser demonstrator.

        "content": "Project aims to demonstrate a fuel efficiency improvement of up to 30% compared to a conventional H145\n\nLONDON, July 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Farnborough Air Show \u2013 Pratt & Whitney Canada and Collins Aerospace, businesses of RTX (NYSE: RTX), have been selected by Airbus Helicopters to support the development of a hybrid-electric propulsion system for its PioneerLab technology demonstrator. Based on a twin-engine H145 helicopter, PioneerLab aims to demonstrate the potential of hybrid-electric propulsion as well as aerodynamic improvements to enable up to 30% improved fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions compared to a conventionally powered aircraft.\n\nFor the PioneerLab demo, the helicopter's existing engines will be replaced by a hybrid-electric propulsion system comprised of a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW210 engine derivative linked with two Collins Aerospace 250 kW electric motors and controllers through a common gearbox. This hybrid-electric configuration is designed to enable optimized engine performance and improved efficiency, with the electric motors providing high torque capability during flight conditions such as take-off and landing.\u00a0Test flights of the hybrid-electric propulsion system are targeted to begin in 2027\u00a0at Airbus Helicopters' site in Donauw\u00f6rth, Germany.\n\n\"With world-class efficiency and reliability, Pratt & Whitney Canada's PW210 engine is very well-suited to perform as part of a hybrid-electric helicopter propulsion system,\" said Maria Della Posta, president, Pratt & Whitney Canada. \"To help achieve the goals of this innovative project, we'll draw on expertise from our growing list of hybrid-electric demonstrator programs, including the RTX Hybrid-Electric Flight Demonstrator, STEP-Tech and SWITCH.\"\n\n\"The combined 250 kW motor and controller we're designing for PioneerLab are part of our family of electric motors and controllers that can be scaled up or down to meet the future electrification needs of aircraft across multiple segments,\" said Henry Brooks, president, Power & Controls for Collins Aerospace. \"By serving as part of hybrid-electric propulsion architectures or helping to electrify onboard systems, these motors and controllers will support the aviation industry's commitment to reduce carbon emissions from future platforms.\"\n\nPioneerLab is supported by Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Actions (BMWK) through its aerospace research program LuFo. Collins will develop the program's 250kW motor and controller at its Electronic Controls and Motor Systems center of excellence in Solihull, UK, with support provided by the UK's Aerospace Technology Institute.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout RTX With more than 185,000 global employees, RTX pushes the limits of technology and science to redefine how we connect and protect our world. Through industry-leading businesses \u2013 Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon \u2013 we are advancing aviation, engineering integrated defense systems, and developing next-generation technology solutions and manufacturing to help global customers address their most critical challenges. The company, with 2023 sales of $69 billion, is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nFor questions or to schedule an interview, please contact corporatepr@rtx.com Cision\n\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rtx-to-collaborate-on-hybrid-electric-system-for-airbus-pioneerlab-helicopter-demonstrator-302202168.html\n\nSOURCE RTX",
