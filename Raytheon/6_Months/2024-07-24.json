        "content": "Ideally, your overall portfolio should beat the market average. But in any portfolio, there will be mixed results between individual stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 22% over a half decade.\n\nSince shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for RTX\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nRTX became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.\n\nIn contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 7.0% a year in the five year period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nRTX is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for RTX in this interactivegraph of future profit estimates.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for RTX the TSR over the last 5 years was 49%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nRTX provided a TSR of 24% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 8% per year. Even if the share price growth slows down from here, there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified  4 warning signs for RTX that you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Here's what to expect.\n\nRTX beat analysts' revenue expectations by 4.9% last quarter, reporting revenues of $19.31 billion, up 12.1% year on year. It was a stunning quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' organic revenue estimates and a decent beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nIs RTX a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting RTX's revenue to grow 5.2% year on year to $19.28 billion, slowing from the 12.3% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.30 per share. RTX Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. RTX has missed Wall Street's revenue estimates three times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at RTX's peers in the aerospace and defense segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Lockheed Martin delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 8.6%, beating analysts' expectations by 6.5%, and Hexcel reported revenues up 10.1%, topping estimates by 3%. Hexcel traded down 7.5% following the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Lockheed Martin's results here and Hexcel's results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the aerospace and defense segment, with share prices up 8.3% on average over the last month. RTX is up 3.2% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $107.7 (compared to the current share price of $104.77).\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.
