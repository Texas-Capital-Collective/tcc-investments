This launch, conducted from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, underscores Northrop Grumman\u2019s leadership in space-based defense technologies.\n\nAdditionally, Northrop Grumman is advancing its Cannon-Based Air Defense (CBAD) program, which aims to create a multi-layered anti-aircraft system. This system, designed to counter modern threats like cruise missiles and attack drones, highlights Northrop\u2019s innovative approach to addressing the evolving needs of global defense.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s collaboration with South Korea\u2019s Genohco to support the KMCH program further cements its position as a key player in international defense.\n\nA Defensive Stronghold In A Volatile Market\n\nFor investors navigating the current market volatility, the defense sector has proven to be a stronghold.\n\nLockheed Martin, RTX Corporation, and Northrop Grumman have not only weathered the recent market crash but have thrived amid rising global tensions.\n\nTheir stock performance over the past month, coupled with their recent strategic advancements, suggests that these companies are well-positioned to continue delivering value to shareholders.\n\nAs the world continues to grapple with geopolitical instability, these defense stocks offer a beacon of stability and growth potential in an otherwise turbulent market.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

        "title": "Institutional investors have a lot riding on RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) with 84% ownership",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, RTX's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 50% of the business is held by the top 11 shareholders Insiders have been selling lately\n\nEvery investor in RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nLast week\u2019s 3.1% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 42%.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of RTX, beginning with the chart below.\n\nSee our latest analysis for RTX  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About RTX?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in RTX. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of RTX, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in RTX. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company with 12% of shares outstanding. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.9% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 8.7% of the company stock.\n\nLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 11 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of RTX\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur information suggests that RTX Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$144m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand RTX better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  4 warning signs for RTX  (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 14 defense contractors stocks we track reported a strong Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 4.9% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 6.7% below.\n\nValuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation.

Our results were strong across the board, including achieving organic growth in the mid-teens, and delivering on our margin and cash flow expectations,\u201d said John Mengucci, CACI President and Chief Executive Officer.
