        "title": "A Look At The Fair Value Of RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nRTX's estimated fair value is US$98.14 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With US$99.55 share price, RTX appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value The US$107 analyst price target for RTX is 9.1% more than our estimate of fair value\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for RTX\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$6.91b US$8.33b US$9.18b US$7.87b US$7.15b US$6.75b US$6.52b US$6.42b US$6.40b US$6.43b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x12 Analyst x7 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ -9.15% Est @ -5.69% Est @ -3.27% Est @ -1.57% Est @ -0.39% Est @ 0.44% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8%  US$6.5k US$7.3k US$7.5k US$6.1k US$5.2k US$4.6k US$4.1k US$3.8k US$3.6k US$3.3k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$52b\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$6.4b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (6.8%\u2013 2.4%) = US$151b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$151b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$78b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$130b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$99.6, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at RTX as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.950. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for RTX\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace & Defense market.\n\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nThreat\n\nDividends are not covered by earnings.\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For RTX, we've compiled three pertinent elements you should further examine:\n\nRisks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.
