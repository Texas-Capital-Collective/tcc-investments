        "title": "RTX (RTX) Up 5.2% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for RTX (RTX). Shares have added about 5.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is RTX due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nRTX Q1 Earnings Surpass Estimates by 9%, Sales Increase Y/Y\n\nRTX Corporation\u2019s first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.34 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 by 8.9%. The bottom line also improved 9.8% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level of $1.22.\n\nIncluding one-time items, the company reported GAAP earnings of $1.28 per share compared with 97 cents in the prior-year quarter.\n\nOperational Performance\n\nRTX\u2019s first-quarter net sales totaled $19,305 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18,412.6 million by 4.8%. The top line also improved 12% from $17,214 million recorded in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nTotal costs and expenses increased 14% year over year to $17,807 million. The company generated an operating profit of $1,870 million compared with $1,687 million in the prior-year quarter.\n\nRTX posted an adjusted operating profit of $2,292 million, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure of $2,153 million.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nCollins Aerospace: Sales in this segment totaled $6,673 million, up 9% year over year.\u00a0 This improvement can be attributed to higher commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM sales, backed by strong demand across commercial aerospace end markets. Increased defense sales driven by higher volume also benefited this unit\u2019s sales.\n\nThe segment\u2019s adjusted operating profit totaled $1,048 million compared with $903 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nPratt & Whitney: This segment\u2019s sales totaled $6,456 million, up 23% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level. The improvement was due to growth in the commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM businesses, driven by higher GTF OE volume and favorable mix, and higher aftermarket volume.Increased military sales, driven by higher sustainment volume across multiple platforms, also contributed to this unit\u2019s sales growth.\n\nAdjusted operating profit amounted to $430 million compared with the year-ago quarter\u2019s level of $434 million.\n\nRaytheon: This segment recorded first-quarter sales of $6,659 million, up 6% year over year, driven by higher sales volume from land and air defense systems, including Global Patriot, counter-UAS systems and NASAMS, and advanced technology programs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe segment\u2019s adjusted operating profit amounted to $630 million, up 8% from $584 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2023.\n\nFinancial Update\n\nRTX had cash and cash equivalents of $5,607 million as of Mar 31, 2024, compared with $6,587 million as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\nLong-term debt totaled $42,334 million as of Mar 31, 2024, up from $42,355 million as of Dec 31, 2023.\n\nNet cash flow from operating activities was $342 million as of Mar 31, 2024, against cash outflow from operating activities of $863 million at the end of first-quarter 2023.\n\nFree cash outflow totaled $125 million at the end of first-quarter 2024 compared with $1,383 million at the end of first-quarter 2023.\n\nGuidance\n\nRTX reiterated its financial guidance for 2024.\n\nThe company still projects adjusted EPS in the band of $5.25-$5.40. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX\u2019s 2024 EPS is pegged at $5.39, higher than the mid-point of the company\u2019s guided range.\n\nRTX continues to expect to generate sales in the band of $78-$79 billion in 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $78.63 billion, which lies above the mid-point of the company\u2019s guidance.\n\nThe company still expects free cash flow of $5.7 billion for 2024.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, RTX has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, RTX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Largest Weapon Manufacturer in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the largest weapon manufacturer in the world. If interested, you can also view our recently released complete list of the 15 Largest Weapon Manufacturers in the World.\n\nLatest figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in April this year estimated the global military spending in 2023 at a record-high of $2.44 trillion, up 6.8% compared to 2022. The year witnessed the steepest rise in defense expenditure since 2009, and was the ninth successive year in which defense spending had increased worldwide.\n\nThe United States continued to remain the largest spender on military expenditure in 2023 as well, having incurred a whopping $916 billion in defense bills during the year, growing 2.3% from last year. Washington\u2019s spending represented 37.5% of the world\u2019s military expenditure, and accounted for 68% of all NATO spending. $588 billion was spent by countries in Europe, which was equivalent to 24% of the global share. Of this amount, an overwhelming 69% was expensed in Central and Western Europe. Both Russia and Ukraine substantially increased their military expenditure during the year, whereas other countries in the region actively racked up their defenses as well with war having returned to the continent after decades of peace.\n\nAnother report by SIPRI highlighted that arms imported by countries in Europe between 2019-2023 were 94% higher than the monetary volume in 2014-2018. The United States was the origin of an estimated 55% of all weapons received by Europe, making the country the largest exporter of arms in the world.\n\nThe spike in defense expenditure has resulted in a boom in the defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s stock price has surged 29% since the start of the war in Ukraine. Several countries in Europe are eying the company\u2019s famed F-35 fifth-generation fighter, while the production of HIMARS is also in full swing to replenish stocks of allies arming Kyiv. This month, the US Army awarded a $861 million contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) for the supply of additional HIMARS, believed to be linked to military assistance for Ukraine. According to the Defense Post, the contract did not specify the number of launchers ordered, but is expected to be around 288 based on previous solicitation documents that were seen.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s numbers have also been promising, having posted $68.9 billion in revenue in 2023, with a year-on-year growth of 3%, aided by the ongoing conflict in Europe. Between February 2022, when the war started, and October 2023, the company had received orders worth $3 billion for its AMRAAM rockets alone to assist Ukraine in pushing back advancing Russian troops. Earlier last year in March, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) also won a $1.2 billion contract from Germany to build Patriot air and missile defense systems for the country and boost its air defenses, while in November, Hungary received the delivery of two units of the NASAMS air defense system it had ordered from Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) too posted its highest-ever revenue in history last year, totaling $42.3 billion, up 7.7% from the previous year. The company has reported an increase in its artillery production from 14,000 rounds per month to 20,000. The company\u2019s 155 millimeter artillery replacements have played a vital role in Kyiv\u2019s fightback against Russia, which have been regularly provided to the country as part of military assistance by the United States.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s take a look at the largest weapon manufacturer in the world. The Largest Weapon Manufacturer in the World\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list, we ranked the largest weapon manufacturers in the world in ascending order of their arms revenue in 2022. This is the latest year for which revenue breakdown is available for all major defense companies in the world. Data has been sourced from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).\n\nThe largest weapon manufacturer in the world is Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).\n\n1. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\n\nCountry of Origin: United States\n\nTotal Revenue in 2022: $65.98 billion\n\nArms Revenue in 2022: $59.39 billion\n\nShare of Overall Revenue: 90%\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is the largest weapon manufacturer in the world, with over $59 billion worth of arms revenue in 2022 \u2013 three-fourths of which came from over $45 billion in DoD contracts. It is the manufacturer of the famed F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet, and the company is likely to retain its status as a cornerstone for the US Air Force as it works alongside other partners in the industry on the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program to build a sixth-generation fighter.\n\nYou can see the rest of the rankings here.\n\nIf you are looking for states where the US military spends the most funds, you can head over to our article on the Top 20 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money.\n\nREAD NEXT:15 Biggest Aircraft Carriers in the World\n\nDisclosure: None.
