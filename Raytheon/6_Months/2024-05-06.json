        "content": "Global military spending for 2023 touched record highs of $2.44 trillion. On a year-on-year basis, defense spending increased by 6.8%. That does not come as a surprise, as there are multiple points of geopolitical friction globally. It\u2019s also likely that defense spending will continue to increase at a healthy pace through the decade. From an investment perspective, it\u2019s a good opportunity to consider exposure to some of the best defense stock picks.\n\nIf we look at some top defense companies, the order backlog has been swelling. Further, companies are investing in next-generation defense technology. A swelling backlog implies clear revenue and cash flow visibility. Investment in R&D will ensure that growth remains healthy as new technology replaces the existing in the coming years.\n\nTherefore, the overall outlook for the defense sector is positive. Even with macroeconomic headwinds, I don\u2019t see a slowdown in defense spending. As a matter of fact, global defense spending increased even during the pandemic years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this overview, let\u2019s discuss three defense stock picks poised to surge higher on the back of potential growth acceleration.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is my top pick from the defense sector. After remaining sideways for the last 12 months, LMT stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 17.9. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 2.73%. With business progress remaining positive, I am bullish on a strong breakout for LMT stock.\n\nAs of Q1 2024, Lockheed reported a strong order backlog of $159 billion. That provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. For the current year, Lockheed has guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion. FCF will likely continue to swell in the coming years on the back of healthy order intake.\n\nAn important point to note is that Lockheed is investing in next-generation defense technology. That includes hypersonics and next-generation interceptors, among others. Investment in research and development will ensure that Lockheed is ahead of the curve. Further, with expanding sales to allies, the addressable market is significant.\n\nLeonardo DRS (DRS)\n\nAmong the emerging defense stocks,Leonardo DRS (NASDAQ:DRS) is worth considering for multibagger returns. DRS stock has trended higher by 35% in the last 12 months. However, the growth stock remains attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 26.8. With a swelling order backlog, I expect growth to accelerate in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs an overview, Leonardo DRS is a provider of defense technologies. For the last financial year, the company clocked revenue and EBITDA of $3 billion and $378 million respectively. It\u2019s worth noting that as of Q1 2024, Leonardo reported an order backlog of $7.8 billion. On a year-on-year basis, the backlog swelled by 84%. If the order intake remains robust, there is a strong case for a healthy upside in EBITDA and cash flows.\n\nI must add here that Leonardo has been consistently investing in R&D. Last month, the company won the 2024 Herschel Award for the \u201cdevelopment of a groundbreaking cooled infrared sensor that unlocks the ability for advanced military and scientific capabilities.\u201d\n\nRTX (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nRTX (NYSE:RTX) has witnessed a healthy rally of 20% for year-to-date. However, the stock remains attractively valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 19.3. Therefore, I expect further upside for this 2.49% dividend yield defense stock.\n\nFor Q1 2024, RTX reported healthy sales growth of 12% on a year-on-year basis to $19.3 billion. For the same period, the company reported a healthy order backlog of $202 billion. That included a $125 billion backlog from the commercial segment and $77 billion from defense. A robust backlog provides clear revenue visibility.\n\nAn important point to note is that the order intake for Q1 2024 was $25 billion. If that pace of intake sustains, organic sales growth will likely remain robust. I must add that RTX has guided for free cash flow of $5.7 billion for the year. That provides ample flexibility to invest in operational modernization and technological innovation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Mission data processing framework rapidly moved from prototype to operations at Battlespace Awareness Center\n\nAURORA, Colo., May 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- An advanced ground system for space-based missile warning developed by Raytheon, an RTX (NYSE: RTX) business, is now operational at the U.S. Space Force's Overhead Persistent Infrared Battlespace Awareness Center (OBAC).\n\nThe Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution Mission Data Processing Application Framework (FORGE MDPAF) is a modular and adaptable framework that enables fast integration of mission focused applications to process, exploit and disseminate information from satellites.\n\nThe current version of FORGE MDPAF is the result of the company working through regular incremental development releases to optimize and add new iterative capabilities.

        "title": "RTX's (NYSE:RTX) Shareholders Will Receive A Bigger Dividend Than Last Year",
        "content": "The board of RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend by 6.8% on the 13th of June to $0.63, up from last year's comparable payment of $0.59. The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.3%, which is in line with the average for the industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for RTX\n\nRTX's Earnings Easily Cover The Distributions\n\nUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Prior to this announcement, RTX's dividend made up quite a large proportion of earnings but only 53% of free cash flows. This leaves plenty of cash for reinvestment into the business.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 127.8% over the next year. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 40% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward. historic-dividend\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $2.14 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.36. Dividend payments have been growing, but very slowly over the period. The dividend has seen some fluctuations in the past, so even though the dividend was raised this year, we should remember that it has been cut in the past.\n\nThe Dividend Has Limited Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Earnings per share has been sinking by 15% over the last five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.\n\nOur Thoughts On RTX's Dividend\n\nIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think RTX's payments are rock solid. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 4 warning signs for RTX that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.
