This is the third option exercised from the March 2022 hardware, production and sustainment contract that is valued up to $3 billion over five years. Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125), equipped with the SPY-6(V)1 radar, completed builder\u2019s trials in Gulf of Mexico in April 2023.

Lucas (DDG 125) that was commissioned in October 2023. The USS Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29) is the second ship and the first to deploy the (V)2 variant. LPD 29 was delivered to the U.S. Navy April 11 following successful completion of builder's and acceptance trials in the Gulf of Mexico. The SPY-6(V)2 radar not only provides defense against missile threats but will also provide air traffic control capability.\n\nThe SPY-6 family of radars is the most tested, most advanced radar technology in production today.
