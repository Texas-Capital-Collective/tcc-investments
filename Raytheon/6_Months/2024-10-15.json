        "title": "RTX (RTX) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when RTX (RTX) reports results for the quarter ended September 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 22. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis an aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $19.91 billion, up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.45% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for RTX?\n\nFor RTX, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.74%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that RTX will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that RTX would post earnings of $1.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.41, delivering a surprise of +9.30%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nRTX doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Collaborative mission autonomy tested in operational settings during U.S. Army exercise\n\nYUMA PROVING GROUND, Ariz., Oct. 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- RTX (NYSE: RTX) businesses, Collins Aerospace and Raytheon, collectively showcased new capabilities at the U.S. Army's Experimental Demonstration Gateway Event (EDGE). These capabilities enabled launched effects to team and execute a mission, merging collaborative vehicle autonomy with human on-the-loop command. Launched effects is a capability term that describes small, uncrewed aircraft that can be launched from the ground, air platforms, or other vehicles.\n\nThe RTX team demonstrated two collaborative autonomy solutions to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess a broad spectrum of threats:\n\nCollins demonstrated its RapidEdgeTM mission system and software toolset as the \"brains\" enabling the collaboration between a team of uncrewed aerial vehicles with various payloads that flew as launched effects surrogates. Raytheon deployed autonomy capabilities previously developed through the Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment government program and showcased Launched Effects capabilities developed for the combat-proven Coyote\u00ae family of unmanned aircraft systems.\n\nBoth solutions were able to share data, seamlessly demonstrating the utility of modular open system architectures and mesh networks.\n\n\"RTX's demonstration at EDGE showed how autonomous sensing and effects can extend the Army's reach, delivering sensing and effects in anti-access or area denial environments,\" said Ryan Bunge, vice president and general manager for Collins' C4I&A portfolio. \"Leveraging capabilities across RTX, we were able to show interoperability between our collaborative autonomy solutions, demonstrating the power and long-term benefits of open system architectures.\"\n\nThis mission system translated the human operator's primary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance goals for the team to act on and outline behavioral parameters according to the Army's playbook for mission execution. The team executed the threat detection mission and decided how best to proceed in real-time, even when command links to the ground operators were severed, validating autonomy for launched effects to help the Army advance this critical capability.\n\nThe demonstration was sponsored by the U.S. Army Futures Command Future Vertical Lift Cross Functional Team to expand the U.S. Army's targeting, reconnaissance and lethality capabilities through manned and unmanned teaming. EDGE is part of the U.S. Army Future Command's campaign of learning to drive transformational advancement across the Army's modernization priorities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout RTX\n\nWith more than 185,000 global employees, RTX pushes the limits of technology and science to redefine how we connect and protect our world.
