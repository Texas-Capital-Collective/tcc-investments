        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corporation LMT and Raytheon, part of RTX Corporation RTX, have been awarded a $1.3 billion follow-on contract by the U.S. Army for Javelin missiles. These missiles have played a significant role in Ukraine's defense. This latest agreement, which builds on a larger contract from last year, could total up to $7.2 billion for an indefinite quantity of missiles between 2023 and 2026.\r\n\r\nThe companies have been increasing Javelin production to meet rising demand and aim to achieve an annual manufacturing capacity of around 4,000 missiles by 2026. The new contract includes the production of more than 4,000 Javelins, mainly to replenish Javelin missile stock that has been sent to support Ukraine.\n\nIncreasing Usage of LMT and RTX\u2019s Javelin Missiles\n\nThe joint venture (JV) between Lockheed Martin and Raytheon is a powerful alliance in the defense industry. These two defense companies have collaborated on various defense projects, with the Javelin missile system being one of their most successful projects. This JV brings together LMT\u2019s extensive experience in missile production and Raytheon\u2019s advanced technology in defense systems, thereby enabling it to meet the U.S. Army's requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Javelin missile is a versatile, shoulder-fired weapon system known for its precision and effectiveness on the battlefield. It automatically guides itself to the target after launch, allowing the gunner to take cover and avoid counterfire. Soldiers or marines using the missile can reposition immediately after firing, or reload to engage another threat. It has been widely used by U.S. forces and allied nations and is currently utilized in Ukraine. The missile\u2019s ability to engage multiple targets, including tanks and fortified positions, has made it an essential tool for modern warfare.\n\nLMT\u2019s Growth Prospects\n\nLockheed Martin secures major defense contracts with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its total backlog was a solid $158.34 billion as of June 30, 2024. The company continues to win defense contracts and support the defense departments of the United States and other allied nations.\r\n\r\nThe global defense sector is seeing strong growth driven by rising geopolitical tensions and the need for advanced military capabilities. The demand for U.S. weaponry, including shoulder-mounted Javelin systems is on the rise, which will further boost LMT\u2019s performance.\n\nProspects of LMT\u2019s Defense Peers\n\nOther defense companies that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding defense market have been discussed below.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation NOC develops and builds some of the world\u2019s most advanced missile defense technology, from command systems to directed energy weapons, advanced munitions and powerful sensors.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Gruman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 5.4%.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation GD is a manufacturer and integrator of land solutions including wheeled and tracked combat vehicles, weapon systems and munitions.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dynamics has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.6%. The consensus estimate for GD\u2019s 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 13.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLMT\u2019s Stock Price Movement\n\nShares of LMT have gained 21.4% in the past three months, compared with the industry\u2019s 5.6% growth.
