        "content": "Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently secured a contract to procure Army Tactical Missile System (\u201cATACMS\u201d) guided missile and launching assembly. The Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL, has provided the award.\n\nValued at $226.9 million, the contract is expected to be completed by Dec 30, 2028. Work related to this deal will be executed in Grand Prairie, TX.\n\nThe contract will serve the governments of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Morocco and Poland.\n\nRising Missile Demand & Lockheed\n\nRapidly increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide, along with heightened regional conflicts in different parts of the globe, like the Middle East, Eastern Europe and the South China Sea over the last decade, have prompted nations to bolster their defense capabilities.\u00a0 Since missiles constitute a large share of a nation\u2019s defense arsenals, countries are investing heftily these days in advanced missile systems for deterrence and defense. This, in turn, has been boosting the demand for technologically advanced missile systems.\n\nWhen it comes to purchase of missiles, Lockheed remains one of the top choices as a missile manufacturer. Notably, the company\u2019s broad portfolio of missile products includes air-to-air missiles to give pilots air supremacy; helicopter-launched anti-armor missiles to destroy enemy tanks and other armored vehicles; man-portable short-range anti-armor and assault weapons; and kinetic energy hyper-velocity missiles.\u00a0 These can defeat all current and future armored threats as well as hit-to-kill air defense systems that protect the troops from ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, enemy aircraft and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn particular, LMT\u2019s ATACMS is a conventional surface-to-surface artillery weapon system capable of striking targets well beyond the range of existing Army cannons, rockets and other missiles. It comes with an improved guidance package with Global Positioning System (\u201cGPS\u201d) and offers a maximum range of 300 kilometers. These features must have been boosting the demand for ATACMS, the latest contract win being a bright example of that.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nWith the ongoing hostilities across the globe, the global peace index indicates an unstable environment. As a result, the demand for military weapons \u2014 especially missiles \u2014 has increased in the defense industry as nations attempt to defend their borders from previously unheard-of attacks.\n\nThis must have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to project that the global missiles and missiles defense system market will witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period. Such growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market should bode well for Lockheed, which is a prominent missile manufacturer.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts major missile programs include the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (\u201cTHAAD\u201d) air and missile defense programs, Multiple Launch Rocket System (\u201cMLRS\u201d), Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (\u201cJASSM\u201d), Long Range AntiShip Missile (\u201cLRASM\u201d), the Hellfire tactical and strike missile programs and the Javelin program, which is an anti-tank precision weapon system.\n\nLMT apart, defense contractors that are likely to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the missiles and missile defense system market are as follows:\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It creates and manufactures warheads, fuses, sophisticated high-speed propulsion systems and other missile components. The company is one of the top suppliers of solid rocket propulsion for air-launched missiles, interceptors, submarine-launched weapons and hypersonic missile systems.\n\nNorthrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2024 sales suggests growth of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nRTX Corp RTX: It offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missiles, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, Evolved Seasparrow Missiles, the Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more. To keep up with its growing demand for a wide variety of missiles, RTX broke ground with a $115 million worth, 26,000-square-foot expansion of its Redstone Raytheon Missile Integration Facility in April 2024.\n\nRTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nThe Boeing Company BA: For almost 25 years, Boeing has been providing the United States, its allies and international partners with air and missile defense systems. The Avenger Air Defense System, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense and a few additional missiles are among its product offerings.\n\nBA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 25.5%. The stock holds an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 17.83%.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of Lockheed have risen 3.2% against the industry\u2019s decline of 10%.
