        "content": "RTX Corporation\u2019s RTX business segment, Raytheon, recently shipped the first AN/TPY-2 radar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 This is RTX\u2019s first AN/TPY-2 radar equipped with a complete Gallium Nitride, or GaN technology, which delivers increased sensitivity, allowing for wider range and surveillance capability.\r\n\r\nThis technology also plays an important role in allowing the AN/TPY-2 radar to assist the hypersonic mission.\n\nRTX\u2019s Expertise in Making Top-Grade Radars\n\nWith the rapid rise of geopolitical tensions in recent years, governments throughout the world have dramatically increased their military arsenals. As radars constitute a crucial component of this arsenal, rising defense spending has resulted in a rise in demand for combat-proven radars.\r\n\r\nThis must have been ushering in a solid order flow for radar manufacturing companies like RTX, whose extensive expertise in radar technology applies to a vast range of advanced radar systems for various applications, including air defense, missile defense, maritime surveillance and a few more. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.\r\n\r\nIn particular, RTX's AN/TPY-2 is a missile defense radar capable of detecting, tracking and distinguishing ballistic missiles. It operates in the X band of the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing it to see objects more clearly. The radar comes in two models \u2014 one for detecting rising ballistic missiles and another for guiding interceptors to a descending warhead.\n\nRTX Stock\u2019s Growth Opportunities\n\nThe need for military radars has skyrocketed in recent years due to several factors, such as rising defense spending in developing countries, increased geopolitical tensions and inter-country conflicts that have heightened threats from missiles and aircraft. This must have prompted the Markets and Markets firm to project a CAGR of 5.4% for the military radar market in the 2024-2029 period. Such growth projections bode well for prominent radar manufacturers like RTX.\r\n\r\nRTX\u2019s product portfolio consists of varied radars like SPY 6, APG-63(V)3, APG-79 and APG-82(V)1 and GhostEye MR and a few more that enjoy solid demand in the global military radar market.\n\nProspects for RTX\u2019s Peers\n\nSome other defense contractors, which are also major radar producers, are projected to gain from the expanding global military radar industry. Those companies have been discussed below.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin LMT: The company\u2019s radars are the choice of more than 45 nations across six continents.
