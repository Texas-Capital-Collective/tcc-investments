        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Could 10X Over the Next 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) stands against other stocks that could 10x over the next 5 years.\n\nDespite ongoing concerns related to the durability of growth and interest rate policy, Deloitte believes that the broader US economy is fundamentally strong. While real GDP growth witnessed some slowness in Q1 2024, growth rebounded to 3.0% in Q2 2024. All the available evidence demonstrates that policymakers have managed to bring inflation under control without a\u00a0recession.\n\nMarket experts opine that the boom in factory construction is expected to boost the economy\u2019s potential over the upcoming years. Deloitte expects that, in the short term, a faster pace of interest rate cuts by the US Fed is expected to allow households to take on more debt and support continued consumer spending growth. This, together with the elevated government consumption, will help the US economy to grow by 2.7% this year.\n\nPathway for Rate Cuts\n\nS&P Global expects that the global policy rate easing cycle remains in full swing after the 50-bps cut by the US Fed in mid-September.\u00a0 The US has been outperforming as growth remains above potential, amidst relatively higher policy and market rates. This above-trend growth stems from services and private investment, new business formation, and productivity.\n\nThe firm believes that the US Fed is on a path to a steady series of interest-rate cuts, and the company is expecting policy rates to reach the terminal rate of 3.00%-3.25% by 2025 end, with risks in both directions. It has kept its probability of a recession starting in the upcoming 12 months unchanged at 25%. With healthy consumption, the company expects that fears of a recession in the near term are overblown.\n\nAmidst Noise, What Are Investment Implications?\n\nEY believes that the US economy is expected to slow into 2025, with restrictive monetary policy and elevated costs curbing the private sector activity. On the positive side, it expects that the recession risks are contained. Households are expected to spend more cautiously, with labor market conditions and income growth softening further. Also, still-elevated financing costs will continue to prompt the businesses to hire and deploy capital with discretion. Investors should know that lower inflation and interest rates, together with a balanced labor market, should result in cooler but more sustainable economic growth in 2025. EY expects real GDP growth to average ~2.7% in 2024.\n\nRegarding consumer spending, Vanguard believes that healthy balance sheets, together with a\u00a0steady labor market, should support consumer spending over the coming quarters, though at a more modest pace as compared to recent quarters.\n\nAs per Merrill (A Bank of America Company), for long-term investors, events such as worker strikes do not often warrant action. Concerning military conflict events, the company has continued to be constructive on Defense stocks for years considering the trend in geopolitical risk. It was highlighted that the pure-play S&P 500 Defense stocks were able to outperform S&P 500 Energy stocks on October 1. This was because of elevated tensions in Israel/Iran and spike in oil prices. Also, defense stocks outperformed when equity volatility increased in July.\n\nTherefore, Merrill believes that defense stocks provide some non-cyclical diversification benefits that cannot be offered by energy. For interest rates, the risks of supply-side inflation warrant the Fed\u2019s attention considering the potential for disinflation to slow or stop. Also, the geopolitical conflict can mean longer-term rates and borrowing rates for the\u00a0private sector remaining higher for longer.\n\nTo put things in perspective, Wall Street analysts opine that, amidst uncertainties, long-term investors should be inclined towards diversification and fundamentally strong companies that offer strong potential for the\u00a0next 3-5 years.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 10 Stocks That Could 10X Over the Next 5 Years, we conducted extensive research and sifted through several online rankings. After extracting the list of 20-25 stocks, we narrowed the list to the following 10 stocks, and ranked them in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?
