        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Worst Aviation Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) stands against the other aviation stocks.\n\nThe aviation industry has been one of the most important segments of the market in the 20th and 21st centuries. The future of aviation is closely tied to the broader landscape of mobility, which is important for economic growth, social connectivity, and access to services like trade, healthcare, and education.\n\nAccording to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the airline industry has made a strong recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, with global traffic surpassing pre-pandemic levels by February 2024. Domestic travel rebounded first,\u00a0 which reached pre-Covid levels by spring 2023, while international travel followed more recently.\n\nHowever, the global network has shifted since 2019. China\u2019s international travel recovered slowly due to the delayed easing of restrictions, economic uncertainties, and geopolitical issues. On the other hand, domestic travel in China hit record highs, driven by internal tourism. Routes between Asia and Europe continue to be affected by the war in Ukraine.\n\nMost regions are expected to exceed 2019 traffic levels in 2024, with global passenger numbers forecasted to grow 10.4% year-over-year.\n\nThe report states that Asia Pacific is the fastest-growing region, which is projected to contribute over half of global passenger growth by 2043 and it is led by India and China. Despite risks like geopolitical conflicts and climate policies, improved economic conditions may boost demand.\n\nAir connectivity, a main driver of global economic growth, is set to hit a record in 2024 with over 22,000 unique city pairs, aided by declining ticket fares. Meanwhile, air cargo demand has rebounded, driven by e-commerce and shipping disruptions. The global capacity is expected to increase further, though the cargo load factor will likely decrease as capacity exceeds demand.\n\nUse of AI in the Industry\n\nLike most industries of today, airlines are also implementing AI to improve the efficiency of their operations. According to an August report by CNBC, these companies are using AI for tasks like ground control, customer service, and optimizing flight routes.\n\nAmerican Airlines introduced its AI-powered \"smart gating\" system at its Dallas-Fort Worth control center. The tool automatically assigns gates to incoming flights, which cut runway taxi time by around 20%, or two minutes per flight, across five airports. The system also helps passengers, baggage, and crews make quicker connections, which improves overall efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlaska is using AI to streamline flight paths and optimize aircraft turnaround times at gates. Its tool is described as \"Waze for the skies,\" and it uses AI to plan faster routes, which saves fuel and reduces delays. Additionally, the system monitors ground operations as it tracks when fuel, catering, and baggage trucks arrive and depart, which allows agents to address delays immediately.\n\nUnited has implemented generative AI for customer service, especially during flight disruptions. The AI generates detailed, empathetic messages explaining delays, which has increased customer satisfaction by 4% since its rollout on 6,000 flights.\n\nDespite these advancements, the airlines said that AI is not replacing jobs but is improving operational efficiency. AI tools allow airlines to improve areas where humans may struggle to handle complex tasks as efficiently. These things, like reducing flight delays or cutting minutes off turnaround times, aim to improve overall service without completely automating operations.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners and ETFs to identify 65 companies above $50 million market cap that have significant operations in the aviation industry. We narrowed our list to 11 companies where less than 50% of the analysts that have covered the stock have Buy-equivalent ratings. In addition, we skipped stocks with an average analyst price target upside above 15%. The stocks are listed in descending order of their average analyst price target upside.\n\nWe also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from our database of over 900 elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

It is one of the world's leading aerospace manufacturers and defense contractors, known for its extensive portfolio that includes advanced aircraft engines, avionics, and aerostructures. The company\u2019s aviation segment has two subsidiaries, Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace.\n\nPratt & Whitney is known for its aircraft engines and gas turbines, which power a diverse range of commercial and military aircraft. Its innovative approach has made it a major player in both the civilian and defense aviation markets, as it offers engines that are essential to the latest advancements in air travel.\n\nCollins Aerospace focuses on developing and manufacturing aerospace systems that improve the performance, safety, and efficiency of various aircraft. The subsidiary is important in supplying advanced avionics, air traffic management systems, and other important technologies that support both military and commercial aviation. Collins Aerospace also plays a significant role in space exploration, which contributes to international space programs with its high-tech solutions.\n\nRTX (NYSE:RTX) stock was held by 54 hedge funds in the second quarter, at a combined value of $2.8 billion. Fisher Asset Management is the company\u2019s largest shareholder with 17.619 million shares worth nearly $1.77 billion, as of June 30.\n\nWhile several analysts are bullish on RTX\u2019s (NYSE:RTX) stock, many are still a little pessimistic. Among 25 analysts, 17 maintain a Hold or below rating for the company. The average price target of $121 represents merely a 1.51% upside to the company\u2019s stock, as of September 16.\n\nOverall RTX ranks 8th on our list of the worst aviation stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of RTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RTX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\nDisclosure: None.
