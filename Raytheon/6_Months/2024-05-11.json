        "title": "RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) Pays A US$0.63 Dividend In Just Four Days",
        "content": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase RTX's shares on or after the 16th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of June.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.63 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$2.36 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, RTX stock has a trailing yield of around 2.2% on the current share price of US$106.32. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether RTX's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether RTX can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nView our latest analysis for RTX\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Last year RTX paid out 95% of its profits as dividends to shareholders, suggesting the dividend is not well covered by earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year it paid out 54% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.\n\nIt's good to see that while RTX's dividends were not well covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. Still, if the company continues paying out such a high percentage of its profits, the dividend could be at risk if business turns sour.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see RTX's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. RTX has delivered 1.0% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because RTX is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nShould investors buy RTX for the upcoming dividend? Growing earnings per share and a normal cashflow payout ratio is an ok combination, but we're concerned that the company is paying out such a high percentage of its income as dividends. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy RTX today.\n\nSo if you want to do more digging on RTX, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces. For example, we've found 4 warning signs for RTX that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

        "title": "What happened to 3D printing stocks?",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the performance and developments surrounding 3D printing stocks.\n\nA big reasons Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is widely credited to be one of the most advanced personal computing companies in the world is the firm's ability to blend in a device's design with high end specifications. A key aspect of product design is manufacturing, which has slowly grown to become one of the most advanced industries in the world. Advances in manufacturing have also nearly completely re shaped the landscape of today's technologies, with one high end manufacturing category, i.e. 3D printing or additive manufacturing, reshaping the way designers, businesses, and consumers produce and order gadgets.\n\n3D printing's utility allows high end jet engine manufacturers, such as General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) subsidiary Pratt & Whitney to fabricate complex components with high degrees of precision. At the same time, it also enables firms like the Ireland based medical device manufacturer Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to create life like models of human organs such as the heart for testing, training, and other uses. For a detailed look at how GE and others are using 3D printing, you should read 10 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy.\n\nWhile the allure of 3D printing to transform industries and generate revenue has always been strong, these stocks, like others that require significant capital investment, fluctuate in response to economic conditions. As proof, consider the performance of the Solactive 3D Printing Index (CHF). It is one of the earliest collections of 3D printing stocks which predates Ark Investment's well known The 3D Printing ETF (BATS:PRNT). Year to date, the Solactive index is down by 2.4%. However, the 3D printing stock index closed 3.9% higher on April 11th, which has proven as one of the most important stock market dates this year. The following day, markets and investor sentiment reworked their expectations for interest rate cuts later this year after evaluating fresh inflation data and earnings from big banks and saw them struggle with high costs which disappointed Wall Street estimates for net interest income. You can read more about this turmoil by clicking on 20 Most Profitable Banks in the US in 2024.\n\nShifting gears, while 3D printing stocks have responded negatively to investors shifting their rate cut expectations forward, individual stocks might be doing better. Some of the oldest 3D printing stocks you're likely to find are Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD). These two have been trading on the stock market since the 1990s, and among them, Startsys's shares have been the better performers. They are up by 466% in all time price gains, for a nice chunk of returns which peaked in 2014 when the shares touched $140. And just as is the case for the Solactive 3D Printing Index (CHF) these 3D printing stocks also jumped in 2021 after investors and media hyped up the potential offered by printers to create alternatives to traditional supply chain and manufacturing resources that were harmed by the post pandemic lockdowns.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese fluctuations are a classic representation of 3D printing stocks, which soar in popularity, see a growth in adoption, and then slowly fade away to bide their time. 2021's 3D printing stock peak also led to this industry joining the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) fever amongst firms eager to try their hand at a public listing. Some 3D printing stocks that went public during this time are Markforged Holding Corporation (NYSE:MKFG), Velo3D, Inc. (NYSE:VLD), and Shapeways Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHPW). Neither of these are stellar performers, and we can't blame them given how high interest rates have gotten since their listing.\n\nOne 3D printing stock that has bucked the trend of being red in 2024 is the Boston based software firm PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC). PTC is an example of the software arm of the 3D printing industry, which benefits from selling manufacturing software firms that rely on 3D printing. This enables it to directly benefit from any growth in the adoption of additive manufacturing technologies. Additionally, in case of a slowdown in 3D printing, PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) also benefits from product management and industrial software which allow it to generate recurring revenue. The shares have gained 6.7% year to date, outpacing the gains of all 3D printing stocks in this introduction and the Solactive 3D Printing Index (CHF).\n\nThe latest bit about this top performing 3D printing stock is for its first quarter earnings. The results saw PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) post $603 million in revenue and $0.95 in earnings per share. These beat analyst estimates of $576 million for revenue and $0.74 for the EPS. At its earnings call, management shared that PTC's Creo software, used primarily in 3D printing applications, had led to an 11% annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth for its CAD business division.\n\nSo, as 3D printing stocks continue to prove to be an interesting bunch, we decided to see which stocks are finding favor with analysts. Analysts spend countless hours pouring over financial statements and business models to decide whether a firm can enhance its cash flow and shareholder value in the future. For 3D printing stocks, their take can provide important insight due to the hurdles that the industry faces with wide scale adoption and the stable potential offered by the software side. Some top 3D printing stocks in this list are Materialise NV (NASDAQ:MTLS), Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS), and FARO Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:FARO).
