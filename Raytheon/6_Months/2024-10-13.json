        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, RTX fair value estimate is US$157 Current share price of US$124 suggests RTX is potentially 21% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 25% higher than RTX's analyst price target of US$125\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for RTX\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$7.04b US$8.36b US$9.92b US$9.50b US$9.31b US$9.25b US$9.28b US$9.37b US$9.50b US$9.67b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x11 Analyst x8 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ -2.01% Est @ -0.66% Est @ 0.29% Est @ 0.95% Est @ 1.42% Est @ 1.74% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3%  US$6.6k US$7.4k US$8.3k US$7.4k US$6.9k US$6.4k US$6.1k US$5.8k US$5.5k US$5.3k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$9.7b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (6.3%\u2013 2.5%) = US$262b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$262b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$142b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$208b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$124, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at RTX as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.918. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for RTX\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by cash flow.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nInterest payments on debt are not well covered.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace & Defense market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nDividends are not covered by earnings.\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?
