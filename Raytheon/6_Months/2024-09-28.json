        "content": "If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. To wit, the RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) share price is 67% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 32% (not including dividends) in the same period. So that should have shareholders smiling. It is also impressive that the stock is up 38% over three years, adding to the sense that it is a real winner.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for RTX\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nOver the last twelve months, RTX actually shrank its EPS by 56%.\n\nSo we don't think that investors are paying too much attention to EPS. Indeed, when EPS is declining but the share price is up, it often means the market is considering other factors.\n\nRevenue was pretty flat year on year, but maybe a closer look at the data can explain the market optimism.\n\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nRTX is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this freechart depicting consensus estimates.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of RTX, it has a TSR of 72% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that RTX shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 72% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 12% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand RTX better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - RTX has  4 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course RTX may not be the best stock to buy.
