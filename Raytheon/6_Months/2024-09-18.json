        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Defense Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) stands against other defense stocks to buy now.\n\nAs we move into 2025 and beyond, the defense industry stands at a critical juncture, where technological advancements, evolving geopolitical threats, and increased spending from both public and private sectors are converging to shape the future of aerospace and defense (A&D). The years ahead promise significant growth opportunities for companies within the sector, especially those positioned at the forefront of innovation and strategic alignment. This article aims to provide a detailed overview of the best investment opportunities in the defense sector, which will be heavily influenced by emerging technologies, hypersonic developments, and the ongoing digital transformation of the industry.\n\nAccording to Deloitte, one of the most exciting developments shaping the defense landscape in years ahead is the emergence of supersonic and hypersonic technologies. NASA\u2019s X-59 QueSST program has been pushing the boundaries of quiet supersonic travel, aiming to reduce sonic boom intensity and revolutionize high-speed aviation. While this technology is still in its nascent stages, manufacturers are optimistic about its potential, having already secured significant investments and collaborations with major airlines. This optimism reflects the increasing recognition that supersonic travel may not just be a technological marvel but an economically viable solution for future air travel.\n\nIn addition to supersonic travel, the defense sector is witnessing an unparalleled surge in demand for hypersonic technology, both for offensive and defensive purposes. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has allocated a substantial budget in fiscal year 2024 to develop and test hypersonic capabilities, including glide vehicles and cruise missiles. As this technology inches closer to operationalization, defense companies are expected to accelerate their efforts to bring hypersonic weapons systems to market, which will likely drive growth in the sector for years to come.\n\nLooking ahead, the A&D industry\u2019s growth will be driven by a combination of defense and commercial spending. With escalating geopolitical tensions, the demand for next-generation defense capabilities is at an all-time high. The global defense budget surpassed $2.24 trillion in 2022, and the U.S. DOD has requested $842 billion for fiscal year 2024, a 3.2% increase from the previous year. This funding surge is set to propel innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), advanced technologies, and the modernization of air, ground, and naval vehicles, all of which will play a crucial role in shaping the defense sector over the next decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should pay close attention to companies involved in the defense supply chain, particularly those engaged in research and development (R&D) of cutting-edge defense equipment. The DOD\u2019s emphasis on AI, microelectronics, quantum computing, and advanced propulsion systems is expected to fuel rapid technological advancements. By focusing on these areas, defense firms can maintain their competitive edge, providing ample opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the sector\u2019s growth potential.\n\nIn addition to traditional defense technologies, the space sector is becoming an increasingly important part of the A&D industry\u2019s future. U.S. spending on space-related defense initiatives has risen sharply, with the U.S. Space Force (USSF) requesting $30.1 billion for fiscal year 2024. This represents a 15% increase from the previous year, and the trend is expected to continue into 2025 and beyond as the U.S. works to maintain its strategic advantage in space. Investments in cybersecurity, space exploration, and resilient space forces will remain a key focus, positioning companies in the space and defense sectors for long-term growth.\n\nWhile the defense industry is set to thrive in the coming years, it is not without its challenges. Inflation, which has been a persistent issue in recent years, is expected to remain a concern as the industry grapples with the rising costs of materials and production. In real terms, the U.S. defense budget increase of 3.2% for fiscal year 2024 may be overshadowed by inflation rates, currently hovering around 6%. This could limit the DOD\u2019s flexibility in launching new missions or advancing certain technologies, as resources are reallocated to cover essential operational costs. Despite these headwinds, companies that can innovate and streamline their supply chains will likely find ways to mitigate these risks.\n\nCommercial aerospace is another area that will see significant investment in the years to come. The recovery of international and domestic passenger traffic to pre-pandemic levels is projected to drive new aircraft orders, with increased spending on digitalization, new product development, and next-generation technologies like Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and space exploration. Companies that can tap into these emerging markets will find themselves well-positioned to benefit from the broader recovery of the aerospace sector.\n\nMoving forward, the AAM sector, in particular, is expected to transition from R&D to full-scale manufacturing and commercialization. Aircraft manufacturers are targeting type certification for their AAM vehicles, with the first wave of commercialization anticipated in 2025. To support these efforts, substantial investments in infrastructure\u2014such as vertiports, charging stations, and pilot training facilities\u2014are expected to drive long-term growth in this emerging market. Companies that position themselves as leaders in AAM technology will be at the forefront of this transformation, offering attractive investment opportunities for those with a forward-looking perspective.\n\nThe future of the defense industry also hinges on the successful integration of digital tools throughout the supply chain. The concept of the \u201cdigital thread,\u201d which connects engineering, manufacturing, and aftermarket activities, is becoming increasingly important as companies look to streamline their operations and reduce time-to-market for new products. By embracing digital transformation, A&D companies can accelerate the certification and commercialization of new technologies, providing a significant competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving industry.\n\nFurthermore, the importance of cybersecurity in the defense sector cannot be overstated. As the industry becomes more digitally interconnected, the risk of cyberattacks increases. In response, defense companies are expected to invest heavily in cyber-resiliency measures to protect sensitive data and critical infrastructure. This focus on cybersecurity will be particularly relevant in 2025 and beyond, as companies work to safeguard their operations against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.\n\nIn addition to technology and innovation, geopolitical factors will continue to shape the defense industry in years ahead. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, tensions in the South China Sea, and the broader competition for global dominance between the U.S. and China are expected to drive further increases in defense spending. The U.S. DOD is investing heavily in next-generation technologies to maintain its strategic advantage in these areas, with a focus on AI, quantum computing, and space capabilities.\n\nMoreover, the private sector\u2019s role in defense innovation is expected to grow as the DOD continues to engage with small businesses, startups, and academia to accelerate the integration of emerging technologies. Initiatives like the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and AFWERX are helping to bridge the gap between the government and the private sector, fostering innovation and driving growth in the defense industry.\n\nFor investors, companies that can successfully navigate these partnerships and bring new technologies to market will offer compelling investment opportunities. As the defense industry looks toward the future, the companies that can embrace technological advancements, adapt to changing geopolitical dynamics, and manage inflationary pressures will be best positioned for long-term success. For investors, identifying the best defense stocks to buy now will require a keen understanding of these trends and an eye for companies that are leading the charge in innovation, digital transformation, and operational excellence.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article we first screened for companies operating in the defense sector and picked the 30 largest companies operating in the space.
