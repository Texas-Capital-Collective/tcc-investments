        "content": "Following the June 27 presidential debate, the leader of Russia, Vladimir Putin, openly stated how seriously he takes former President Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to ending the war in Ukraine. With Trump vocal about the importance of ending America\u2019s wars, it\u2019s likely the defense industry will take a hit following the closure of Europe\u2019s biggest war in almost 80 years. As a result, it\u2019s highly likely that there will be several defense stocks to sell to maximize profits now from medium-term holdings.\n\nThis isn\u2019t because these companies are financially insolvent or no longer relevant during a Trump presidency, but rather because they are not as heavily funded by the government as they are under the current Biden administration. As such, investors may want to prepare for the eventuality that the bull run the defense industry stocks had in 2022 and 2023 will likely come to an end should Trump and his foreign policies prevail in November.\n\nRTX (RTX) A German army mobile Raytheon (RTX) MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) system on display during the Laage airbase open house.\n\nSource: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the defense stocks to sell with the most confidence from institutional investors, RTX (NYSE:RTX) has benefited greatly from the war in the Middle East. Today the company operates as a conglomerate of three major components, Raytheon Technologies, Collins Aerospace, and Pratt & Whitney. This results in a defense corporation whose revenue incomes are partially exposed to commercial market trends, but buffered by defense spending. Yet two major problems could arise from a Trump presidency.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirstly, Congress might want to increase funding for Ukraine, but Trump can veto the bills. Pair this with Republican lawmakers who have been more skeptical of foreign aid compared to Democrats, and RTX could lose big. That\u2019s because a spending cut in Ukraine could impact RTX\u2019s bottom line, as they recently secured a $282 million contract to supply air defense systems to the country.\n\nSecondly, a potential re-election of Donald Trump could pose a challenge. Trump has publicly advocated for ending the wars in Israel and Ukraine. This stance could threaten RTX\u2019s $1.7 billion program to provide Patriot missiles to both NATO and Israel. Thus, it\u2019s clear that a change in government policy could cut deep into RTX\u2019s booked revenues and impact future performance.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite being the biggest name in the modern aerospace industry, Lockheed Martin\u2019s (NYSE:LMT) outlook after the 2024 election could decrease significantly. Despite its recent contract wins in the satellite sector, its contracts to supply Javelin missiles and F-35s could be at risk of cuts to NATO funding and military acquisitions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Trump has widely advocated for spending cuts on the grossly overbudget F-35 program. In fact, seven years ago, the former president tweeted how billions of dollars need to be saved on out-of-control programs like the F-35. This slashed LMT\u2019s stock value by $4 billion in the days following his tweet.\n\nThis kind of rhetoric from Trump helps underscore his commitment to better managing taxpayer money, which in turn means less financial flexibility for contractors like LMT. Thus, should the former president return to office, he could enact sweeping measures to reign in government spending on the admittedly over-engineered fighter jet.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD) image of General Dynamics (GD) website, representing dividend stocks\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the primary producer of the M1 Abrams tank, which recently saw action in Ukraine, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) stands to lose a significant source of revenue potential in the event of peace in Eastern Europe. Considering that Trump openly intends to end this war, the potential resupply revenue that would come from expended tanks and other military materials produced by General Dynamics could come to a quick close.\n\nMoreover, while the company is very broadly diversified across several different defense sectors from aviation to maritime to ground systems, the Trump administration may curtail some spending on the programs that General Dynamics relies on beyond the M1 tank program.\n\nAs a result, investors may want to consider taking profits on General Dynamics\u2019 strong run over the last few years before it corrects in the face of a more conservative administration on the side of foreign policy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget AI...

        "content": "Defense Contractors Stocks Q1 Results: Benchmarking Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season comes to a close, it\u2019s time to take stock of this quarter's best and worst performers in the defense contractors industry, including Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and its peers.\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 13 defense contractors stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.5%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.7% above consensus. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, and defense contractors stocks have held roughly steady amidst all this, with share prices up 1.7% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)\n\nHeadquartered in Maryland, Famous for the F-35 aircraft, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) specializes in defense, space, homeland security, and information technology products.\n\nLockheed Martin reported revenues of $17.2 billion, up 13.7% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 7.5%.
