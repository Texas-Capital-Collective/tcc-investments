        "content": "Modern warfare is evolving, and Anduril Industries has a plan to capitalize on this shift by reimagining the design and production of American military power.\n\nThe defense technology startup recently raised $1.5 billion in a new funding round to scale its weapons manufacturing. The deal, which was co-led by Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund and Sands Capital, values Anduril at $14 billion, nearly double the startup\u2019s valuation after its previous funding round two years ago.\n\nAnduril\u2019s strategy is to increase American weapons manufacturing by replicating the modern techniques and processes employed by commercial powerhouses such as Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla (TSLA). In other words, it's using a software-first approach flexible enough to build weapons quickly and at scale.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing at Anduril is we are taking the risk up front to build the capabilities and to build the infrastructure that we need to deploy those capabilities very quickly,\u201d Trae Stephens, co-founder and executive chairman of Anduril and partner at Founders Fund, told Yahoo Finance (video above).\n\n\u201cNow is that a bet on ourselves that, once we produce these things, the customer will show up to buy it?\u201d Stephens asked. \u201cAbsolutely, but I think that is the way it should work. There should be some risk taken from an industry perspective as well.\u201d A Border Patrol agent walks by an Autonomous Surveillance Tower made by Anduril near Sunland Park, New Mexico, on Jan. 18, 2022. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nAnduril plans to use the majority of the funds to invest in a new software-defined manufacturing platform and build a new manufacturing facility called Arsenal-1.\n\nThe factory is expected to ultimately employ more than 1,500 people, encompass more than 5 million square feet of manufacturing capacity, and produce tens of thousands of weapons, such as counterstrike drones and autonomous submarines, per year.\n\nWhile the company has not yet determined where the Arsenal-1 facility will be located, it already has experience building out its manufacturing footprint.\n\nIn June, Anduril announced a $75 million investment to increase manufacturing and production capacity for solid rocket motors in Mississippi. That same month, the company also announced the opening of a facility in Rhode Island, enabling Anduril to increase production of underwater drones.\n\nStartups like Anduril, which aim to disrupt the American defense industry and take on the \"primes\" \u2014 giants like Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Dynamics (GD), RTX (RTX), and Northrop Grumman (NOC) \u2014 have attracted venture investors to the sector. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nBetween 2021 and mid-June of this year, venture capitalists invested $130 billion in defense tech startups, according to PitchBook.\n\nStory continues\n\nNick Beim, a partner at venture firm Venrock, explained investors are eager to invest in the next Anduril, Palantir (PLTR), or SpaceX.\n\n\u201cThe character of warfare is changing significantly due to emerging technologies,\u201d Beim recently told Yahoo Finance. \u201cI think the future of warfare will be much more driven by AI software and autonomous systems at the edge than by the traditional military platforms that are used today.\u201d\n\n\u201cVenture-backed companies are now best positioned to provide these critical systems, better positioned than the traditional military suppliers,\u201d Beim added.\n\nStephens declined to say when Anduril would IPO but told Yahoo Finance the company is considering such a move.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to think a lot more about that three- to five-year kind of timeline for being ready to go if the market conditions were right and the company continues to grow as well as we have been,\u201d he said.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",
