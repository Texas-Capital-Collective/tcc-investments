        "content": "This article looks at countries that receive the most US foreign military aid. You can skip our detailed analysis of how Washington has aided its allies amid security challenges in recent years, and head over directly to the U.S. Foreign Military Aid by Country: Top 5 Countries.\n\nGlobal military spending reached a record high of $2.44 trillion in 2023, having grown 6.8% compared to the year before. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), this is the biggest percentage spike in defense expenditure since 2009 and the ninth consecutive fiscal year during which military spending has increased.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Countries That Provided the Highest Military Aid to Ukraine and 25 Countries That Receive the Most Foreign Aid From the US.\n\nThe United States spent $916 billion on defense last year, representing 37.5% of the global military expenditure. The figure also amounted to 68% of NATO\u2019s total defense bill during the year. A considerable portion of the overall spending from Washington went to providing military assistance to Ukraine in its war against Russia, and in aiding Israel as it advances against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. In April this year, President Biden signed into law a $95 billion war aid assistance package for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and other countries in global hot spots. According to Reuters, much of this is expected to go into the procurement of pricey, advanced military equipment from aerospace and defense giants such as Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and more.\n\nThe surge in global military spending amid the volatile situation in Europe and the Middle East has created a boom in the defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s share price has spiked 55% since Russia invaded Ukraine, from $361 in February 2022 to its current level of $558 per share, due to strong demand for its weapons, such as HIMARS, GMLRS, and the F-35. The company generated over $67 billion in revenues in 2023, of which an estimated 96% was defense-related. With no immediate end to the conflicts in sight, the stock is set to further strengthen. According to Insider Monkey, 47 hedge funds were bullish about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)\u2019s shares have also soared 33% since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. Last month, the company finalized a co-production agreement with a Ukrainian firm Ukroboronservice to manufacture medium-caliber ammunition in the country. Under the contract, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) will provide equipment and training to Ukroboronservice to establish an assembly line in the country to produce and test these weapons.\n\nOn the other hand, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is currently working on a 2022 contract worth $927 million to deliver Israel's four KC-46A Pegasus aircraft in the next few years. The company also accelerated work on an order for 1,000 small-diameter bombs for Israel, under a contract signed in 2021, after Hamas launched an attack on Israel in October last year.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is flying high as well amid strong financial results. The company posted a revenue of $69 billion in 2023 and has made a robust start to the first half of the ongoing fiscal year. During the first quarter, it generated $19.3 billion in sales and an EPS of $1.34, which was 10% higher YoY. The company fared even better in the second quarter, registering a revenue of $19.8 billion and an EPS of $1.41.\n\nAnticipating a sustained demand for its weapons and other offerings, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has revised its full-year outlook with total revenue now forecast between $78.5 to $79.5 billion, up from the prior range of $78 to $79 billion. The company has also revised its EPS expectations to between $5.35 - $5.45, compared to $5.25 - $5.40 in the earlier quarter. It is one of the best defense stocks to buy right now.

Despite that, it ranks among the top recipients of US military aid during the last five years due to a whopping $6.1 billion being disbursed between 2019 and 2021. In fact, between 2001 and 2021, Washington provided almost $73 billion in military aid to Kabul to fight the Taliban and other militant groups such as Al Qaeda and ISIS.\n\n2.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Raised Their Dividend in Each of the Last 3 Recessions",
        "content": "The economy doesn't always go up; recessions occur when the economy contracts, which can have real-world consequences for consumers, businesses, and the stock market. Despite recession talk ramping up in the media, nobody knows when the next recession will happen or how severe it will be. Investors can prepare their portfolios by looking for stocks with a proven long-term growth history.\n\nDividend stocks are great for this. Companies that have raised their dividends for the past 25 consecutive years have done well enough to continue paying shareholders more despite recessions following the dot-com bubble, the financial crisis, and the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOnly high-quality companies with durable competitive advantages, prudent management teams, and healthy fundamentals can pull that off.\n\nHere are three stocks from that group that investors can count on during thick and thin.\n\n1. RTX\n\nSome industries may slow when the economy lags, but defense and aerospace seldom stop moving. RTX (NYSE: RTX) is a leader in both sectors. The company was formed after a recent merger, joining Raytheon with United Technologies and creating a three-headed conglomerate. RTX's core business includes building aviation systems for private and military applications, jet engines for commercial and military aviation, and various defense and weapons systems for the military. Large mergers sometimes backfire, but RTX remains in solid financial shape with an investment-grade credit rating.\n\nRTX has a 31-year dividend growth streak that should continue for years. RTX will pay $2.52 per share in dividends this year, less than half the $5.44 analysts believe the company will earn. Additionally, those earnings are poised to grow by more than 10% annually for the next three to five years. Investors can enjoy a solid 2.1% starting yield and reasonably expect double-digit increases.\n\nRemember that defense and aviation are highly regulated industries with steady demand. The COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented event that virtually halted the aviation industry. It's the only time RTX's annual revenue dropped 15% or more in decades. And yet RTX still raised the dividend. Investors can feel confident holding this diversified dividend stock with long-term growth potential.\n\n2. Sherwin-Williams\n\nPaints and coatings are remarkably simple products that generate recurring sales from new buildings, home construction, and renovations. Sherwin-Williams(NYSE: SHW) leads the industry and is a dividend rock star with an active dividend growth streak spanning 46 years. There isn't much proprietary about paint, but Sherwin-Williams boasts a strong brand that resonates with DIY and building professionals alike. Sherwin-Williams sells its products through company-owned stores, retail stores, and distributors. It's a boring business, but it has staying power; paints and coatings will probably never become obsolete.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors won't find a colossal starting yield here; Sherwin-Williams only yields 0.8%. However, the stock's rapid price appreciation helps make up for it. Shares have outrun the S&P 500 over the past decade. The dividend is only a quarter of the company's estimated 2024 earnings, so there is much room for future dividend raises that will easily outpace inflation.\n\nSherwin-Williams is very consistent; annual revenue has only dropped more than 10% once since the early 1990s. Investors looking for growth should consider Sherwin-Williams a dynamite compounder with room to raise its dividend dramatically over the coming decade and beyond.\n\n3. NextEra Energy\n\nRenewable energy has been growing steadily for decades, and leading renewable energy company NextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE) has been a big winner. It operates wind and solar energy products, energy storage, and America's largest electric utility, Florida Power & Light. The company issues debt and stock to fund its energy projects, but management generates enough investment returns to make a profit and pay investors dividends. NextEra's growth and dividends have generated market-crushing total stock returns since the 1980s despite doubling its share count.\n\nThe company has raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years. Investors will receive $2.06 this year for each share they own, roughly 65% of NextEra's expected earnings per share. Investors shouldn't worry about management continuing to cut those dividend checks; NextEra's utility business is virtually recession-proof since people always need electricity, and renewable energy is only getting bigger.\n\nToday, wind and solar energy still only contribute 13% of America's total electricity, but that number is poised to increase. That rising tide will impact all renewable energy companies, but NextEra's title as the world's leading producer almost ensures the company will continue growing well into the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in RTX right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in RTX, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and RTX wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Q2 Rundown: RTX (NYSE:RTX) Vs Other Defense Contractors Stocks\n\nLet\u2019s dig into the relative performance of RTX (NYSE:RTX) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q2 defense contractors earnings season.\n\nDefense contractors typically require technical expertise and government clearance. Companies in this sector can also enjoy long-term contracts with government bodies, leading to more predictable revenues. Combined, these factors create high barriers to entry and can lead to limited competition. Lately, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan\u2013highlight the need for defense spending. On the other hand, demand for these products can ebb and flow with defense budgets and even who is president, as different administrations can have vastly different ideas of how to allocate federal funds.\n\nThe 14 defense contractors stocks we track reported a very strong Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 4.9% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 6.7% below.\n\nInflation progressed towards the Fed\u2019s 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. On the other hand, 2024 has been a bumpier ride as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts and inflation. Thankfully, defense contractors stocks have been resilient with share prices up 7.1% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nRTX (NYSE:RTX)\n\nOriginally focused on refrigeration technology, Raytheon (NSYE:RTX) provides a a variety of products and services to the aerospace and defense industries.\n\nRTX reported revenues of $19.72 billion, up 7.7% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.3%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 organic revenue estimates.\n\n\"RTX delivered strong operational performance in the second quarter, with 10 percent organic sales* growth, adjusted margin* expansion across all three segments and $2.2 billion in free cash flow*,\" said RTX President and CEO Chris Calio.
