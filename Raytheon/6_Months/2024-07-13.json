The company is structured into three primary segments: Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon. Recently, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) was awarded a contract modification worth $33.8 million by the Naval Sea Systems Command in Washington, D.C. This contract entails supplying spare parts for the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) program. Additionally, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is facing a class action lawsuit alleging age discrimination. Filed by the AARP Foundation and two law firms in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the lawsuit claims that certain job advertisements from Raytheon displayed a preference for younger candidates. This alleged bias contravenes the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Act, and the Virginia Human Rights Act. The company, initially based in Massachusetts, has recently moved its headquarters to Virginia. The number of hedge funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database owning stakes in RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) grew to 62 in Q1 2024, from 61 in the preceding quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is nearly $2.42 billion. Among these funds, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q1.\n\nRTX managed to grow its topline by high single digits since the end of 2020 and currently trade at a forward P/E of 19. It is slightly undervalued if we assume that it will continue to grow at its current rate. However, bullish investors think many countries are prioritizing national security and are willing to invest more in advanced weaponry and defense systems. Rising tensions around the world, like the ongoing war in Ukraine, are prompting governments to gradually increase their military budgets and this will translate to more contracts and revenue for defense companies. That's why RTX is attracting a large number of smart investors.\n\nOverall RTX ranks 10th on our list of the best industrial stocks stocks to buy.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in RTX implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 50% of the business is held by the top 11 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nA look at the shareholders of RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about RTX.\n\nSee our latest analysis for RTX  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About RTX?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nRTX already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at RTX's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in RTX. The company's largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company, with ownership of 12%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 8.7% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 11 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of RTX\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur information suggests that RTX Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$129m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over RTX. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 4 warning signs  with RTX , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
