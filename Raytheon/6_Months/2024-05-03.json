        "title": "RTX's new generation of commercial satellite imagers launches with Maxar's WorldView Legion",
        "content": "Advanced imagers will provide high-resolution visual data in real time\n\nARLINGTON, Va., May 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Two next-generation imaging instruments designed by Raytheon, an RTX (NYSE: RTX) business, launched yesterday as part of Maxar's WorldView Legion satellites. These are the first two of six planned WorldView Legion satellites, which will provide a significant leap forward in Earth observation capabilities, offering improved surveillance and monitoring for a wide range of applications. Raytheon\u2019s imager was designed using digital engineering practices.\n\nPositioned in low Earth orbit, the satellites will provide the highest commercially available resolution, and when all six join the Maxar Intelligence constellation, they will enable a revisit rate of up to 15 times per day over the most populated parts of Earth. These WorldView Legion satellites will support applications across multiple sectors, including national security, military and commercial mapping, maritime monitoring, telecommunications network planning, change detection and feature identification.\n\n\"Raytheon's advanced instrument technology sets a new industry standard, providing 30cm high-resolution satellite imagery that enables WorldView Legion to fulfill today's customer needs and adapt to the evolving needs of tomorrow,\" said Nicholas Yiakas, director of Civil, Commercial, and Special Programs for Raytheon.\n\nRaytheon's innovative telescope design is the culmination of 15 years of research and development into a novel optical material that is stronger and lighter than previous designs. As part of the effort, Raytheon received 8 patents with the U.S. Patent Office. The combination of lighter optics and electronics allowed Maxar to successfully reduce spacecraft mass by more than two times, reducing time to orbit and launch costs.\n\nThe high-resolution image is focused onto a next-generation digital focal plane array designed and built by Raytheon to provide high-resolution multispectral images.\n\nThe satellite imagery collected by WorldView Legion will aid in assessing humanitarian needs, providing aid to natural disasters and businesses with transformational capabilities including mapping and logistical planning, insights to world events and supporting national defense.\n\nAbout Raytheon \r\nRaytheon, an RTX business, is a leading provider of defense solutions to help the U.S. government, our allies and partners defend their national sovereignty and ensure their security.

        "title": "Top 20 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 20 states where the US military spends the most money. You can skip our detailed analysis on the breakdown of the Department of Defense (DoD)\u2019s spending by state and head over directly to the Top 5 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money.\n\nFigures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) last month revealed that global military spending reached an all-time high of $2.44 trillion in 2023, increasing 6.8% in real terms compared to 2022. This is the steepest year-on-year rise in defense expenditure since 2009. The report also highlighted that world military expenditure has now been increasing for the last consecutive nine years.\n\nDefense spending in the United States grew 2.3% to total $916 billion in 2023, which amounted to 37.5% of the global military expenditure, and represented 68% of all NATO military spending. On the other hand, Russia\u2019s defense bills also witnessed a 24% increase in 2023 amid the war in Ukraine. Israel\u2019s military expenditure rose 24% as well compared to 2022, driven by its large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza. India and Saudi Arabia also continued to spend heavily on defense during the year.\n\nThe surge in spending has a created a boom in the global defense industry, especially for aerospace and armaments manufacturers in the United States \u2013 a country that accounts for nearly two-fifths of all global military spending, and is home to several top defense contractors countries across the world looks toward to procure their military supplies from.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) generated $67.6 billion in revenues in 2023, reporting an increase of 2.4% in comparison to 2022. The aerospace company\u2019s net earnings were also $1.2 billion higher compared to last year. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)\u2019s numbers soared as well, with sales reaching a whopping $68.9 billion in 2023, having grown 3% year-on-year. On the other hand, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) posted its highest revenue in history, totaling $42.3 billion last year \u2013 which was 7.3% higher than in 2022.\n\nAs a result, the United States continues to retain its military superiority over its rivals, and given the advanced research and development ongoing in the country\u2019s defense industry, this trend is likely to stay for the foreseeable future. The country is already looking ahead to the future, and working on building weapons tailored to address the rapidly evolving dynamics of modern warfare.\n\nAn example of that is the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Program launched by the United States Air Force (USAF) in 2014 to develop the sixth-generation fighter jet to replace Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)\u2019s F-22 Raptor. The USAF requested $1.7 billion in its FY24 budget for the project which is likely to cost $16 billion between 2023 and 2028. Five companies \u2013 Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) \u2013 are working on the NGAD Program, with each being awarded contracts worth $975 million in 2022 for a period of ten years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe enormous sums of money that go into the American defense industry for the procurement of new military equipment by the US government and foreign buyers, and the research and development to develop improved weaponry, heavily influences the US economy in many ways. However, the spending is not evenly distributed across all states. Understandably so, states that are home to major defense companies and host a larger number of military installations receive a greater share of this money.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) in September 2023 released a report on its contract obligations and spending across various states of the United States in 2022. Of the $558.7 billion spent that year, 70% went into contracts for products and services, while 28% were used to pay salaries of DoD\u2019s personnel. 2% of the total amount was awarded as grants. Let\u2019s now take a look at top states where the US military spends the most money. Top 20 States Where the US Military Spends the Most Money\n\nFrontpage/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nThe top 20 states where the US military spends the most money are ranked in ascending order of the DoD spending by state in billions of dollars. 2022 is the latest year for which data is available, and was released by the Department of Defense in September 2023. In cases where the estimated, rounded figure of defense spending was similar for two or more states, we outranked one over the other on the basis of defense spending per resident, with the state having the greater value ranking higher in the list.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.
