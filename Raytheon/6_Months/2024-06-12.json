        "content": "LAFAYETTE, Colo., June 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- RTX's (NYSE: RTX) small satellite manufacturer and mission services provider, Blue Canyon Technologies, was selected to build two 12U\u00a0CubeSat buses for NASA's PolSIR mission, which will study ice clouds that form at high altitudes throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions. In addition to designing and manufacturing the bus platforms, Blue Canyon will also provide mission operations services. Blue Canyon Technologies will design and manufacture the bus platforms and provide mission operations services for NASA\u2019s PolSIR mission.\n\nThe PolSIR instrument \u2013Polarized Submillimeter Ice-cloud Radiometer\u2013 will observe the full diurnal cycle of high-altitude ice clouds to improve climate forecasts and provide climate models with important insights on how Earth's atmosphere will change in the future.\n\n\"Supporting this critical mission builds on our heritage of weather monitoring missions including TEMPEST-D and TROPICS,\" said Chris Winslett, general manager of Blue Canyon Technologies.\n\nEach spacecraft will be equipped with radiometers that will observe the clouds' daily cycle of ice content through two separate wavelengths in two spectral bands and will fly in orbits separated by three to nine hours. Over time, these two instruments will observe the clouds' daily cycle of ice content.\n\nNASA Goddard will provide the project management team that builds the two instruments for the Principal Investigator led mission from Vanderbilt University, and science operations will be conducted by the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison. \u00a0For more information on the PolSIR mission, visit vanderbilt.edu/polsir.\n\nAbout Blue Canyon Technologies  \r\nBlue Canyon Technologies (BCT), RTX's small satellite manufacturer and mission services provider, offers a diverse portfolio of innovative, reliable, and affordable spacecraft and components that enable a broad range of missions and technological advancements for the new space economy.
