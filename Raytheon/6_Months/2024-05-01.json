By maintaining TAAG's PW150A engines we are helping to ensure optimal aircraft availability and engine asset management.\"\n\nThe agreement also includes Pratt & Whitney's proprietary oil-analysis technology and its FAST\u2122 diagnostic and prognostic solution which captures, analyzes and wirelessly sends full-flight data intelligence to the customer within minutes of engine shutdown.\n\n\"With a roughly 75-passenger capacity, optimal fuel efficiency, and overall reliability, the PW150A-powered Dash 8-400 fits our needs,\" said Nelson de Oliveira, CEO, TAAG Airlines. \"P&WC's FMP program is ideal for us as we can rely on the proven expertise of the engine original equipment manufacturer to ensure we gain maximum productivity and efficiency from our PW150A engines.\"\n\nFleet Management Programs are flexible, high-value maintenance planning solutions that lower operating costs and simplify fleet operations management. Tailored to suit the unique requirements of fleet operators and airlines, Pratt & Whitney's FMPs allow customers to focus on their core business and eliminate the overhead and logistical challenges of operating a maintenance facility.\n\nThe PW100/PW150 engine family powers 90 percent of 30- to 90-passenger regional turboprop aircraft operating today. These turboprop engines consume 25 to 40% less fuel and produce 50% fewer CO2 emissions than similar-sized regional jets. The engines offer airlines the best life cycle costs and help sustain an aircraft's value.\u00a0In 2024, the engine family is celebrating the 40th anniversary of its entry into service.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about Pratt & Whitney's history of innovation\u00a0here.\n\nAbout Pratt & Whitney Pratt & Whitney is a\u00a0world leader in the design, manufacture and service of aircraft engines and auxiliary power units.\n\nAbout RTX\r\nWith more than 185,000 global employees, RTX pushes the limits of technology and science to redefine how we connect and protect our world.
