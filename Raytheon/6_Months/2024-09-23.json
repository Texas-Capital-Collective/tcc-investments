We are looking forward to many more years of successful cooperation with Pratt & Whitney.\"\n\nThe 17-year per-engine agreement provides airBaltic with greater transparency and predictability in maintenance planning and associated costs.\n\n\"We will provide long-term support to airBaltic to optimize fleet performance as they expand their route network,\" said Rick Deurloo, president of Commercial Engines at Pratt & Whitney. \"We appreciate the airline's continued confidence in the GTF engine and the value it provides with industry-leading fuel efficiency, lower carbon emissions and smaller noise footprint.
