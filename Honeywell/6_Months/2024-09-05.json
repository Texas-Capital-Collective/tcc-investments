        "title": "Honeywell International Inc. (HON): One of the Best Battery Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Battery Stocks To Buy Now According to Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) stands against the other battery stocks.\n\nElectric vehicles are the latest trend in the automotive market which is revolutionizing the whole industry. According to Grand View Research, the global electric vehicle (EV) market was valued at $1.07 trillion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.6% from 2024 to 2030 and reach $8.85 trillion by the end of the forecast.\n\nThe growth is driven by government policies, incentives, and advancements in battery technology, which are making EVs more affordable and appealing. The transportation and logistics sectors are increasingly adopting EVs due to their lower emissions and operational costs, with companies like Amazon integrating electric trucks into their fleets.\n\nSimilarly, Grand View Research believes that the global EV battery market was valued at $44.69 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 21.1% from 2023 to 2030. Strategic collaborations among battery manufacturers, e-mobility providers, and energy suppliers are improving battery durability and lifespan, while the increasing production of EVs in countries like China, Germany, and Japan, along with government investments in EV charging infrastructure, is further accelerating the market. However, fluctuating raw material prices, such as lithium-ion, could impact production costs.\n\nThe Growing Importance of Critical Minerals in Energy Transition\n\nAccording to BP\u2019s Energy Outlook 2024, the transition to a low-carbon energy system will require a substantial increase in the use of critical minerals, such as copper, lithium, and nickel, essential for supporting the infrastructure and assets needed for this transition. According to the report, the rapid expansion of electric vehicles is projected to reach 1.2 billion (current trajectory) to 2.1 billion (goal to reach Net Zero) by 2050, which will significantly increase the demand for batteries and in turn, higher demand for minerals like lithium and nickel.\n\nCopper demand is expected to rise by 75-100% by 2050, mostly due to its use in EVs and the extension of electricity networks. Lithium demand could grow 8 to 14 times by 2050, mainly driven by its use in EV batteries, which will account for about 80% of total lithium demand by 2050. Lastly, nickel demand is projected to increase two to three times by 2050, with most of this growth linked to lithium-ion batteries in EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Competitive Pricing and Leasing Are Shaping the EV Market\n\nIn an interview at CNBC Power Lunch, Erin Keating, Cox Automotives executive analyst, explored the factors shaping the EV market. She noted that Tesla and Chevy initially dominated EV sales, which is why a growing supply of used cars from the former is now available. These used EVs have become more affordable, partly due to tax credits of up to $4,000. This is helping to drive sales in the used EV market and making it a more attractive option for consumers.\n\nHowever, the lease market is offering deals that compete with used EV prices. According to Keating, while this puts downward pressure on used EV prices, she emphasized the benefit of the situation and said that more leased vehicles today will enter the used market in a few years, which will ensure a steady supply of affordable used EVs in the future.\n\nKeating also addressed the issue of buyer\u2019s remorse, as some people are frustrated with the slower development of EV infrastructure and range anxiety. Despite this, she reassured consumers that the batteries in used EVs are holding up well with minimal degradation.\n\nIt means consumers can trust the longevity of these vehicles, and automakers are committed to supporting them. Although some challenges remain, she believes that as infrastructure improves, consumer confidence and adoption of EVs will continue to grow.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners and ETFs including Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF and Lithium & Battery Tech ETF to identify companies involved in the EV battery market. We then selected 10 stocks with the smallest short interest and listed them in descending order of their short interest. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA shot of a commercial plane with a blur of color in the background, representing the production of auxiliary power units in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment.\n\nHoneywell International Inc.
