        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - Honeywell did not violate workplace anti-discrimination laws by firing a white engineer who refused to participate in mandatory diversity, equity and inclusion training after the Black Lives Matter movement began, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Wednesday.\n\nThe 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago found no proof that Honeywell retaliated against Charles Vavra, after he complained a video he was supposed to watch on preventing unconscious bias in the workplace contained racist content.\n\nIn a 3-0 decision, the court said Vavra had no basis to reasonably believe the video violated Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act or an Illinois human rights law, because he never watched the video in the first place.\n\nVavra assumed the training \"would vilify white people and treat people differently based on their race,\" Circuit Judge Thomas Kirsch wrote. \"But that presumption is purely speculative and insufficient to make his belief objectively reasonable.\"\n\nThe judge also said Vavra had reason to believe Honeywell's training was not discriminatory, because his supervisor had taken the training and told him it was not racist.\n\nKirsch and the other two appeals court judges were appointed to their positions by former President Donald Trump.\n\nLawyers for Vavra did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Honeywell and lawyers for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based industrial conglomerate did not immediately respond to similar requests.\n\nThe decision came amid growing complaints by some conservative groups and shareholders about the alleged illegality of workplace initiatives to counteract bias.\n\nUnconscious bias training became more common after a Minneapolis police officer's murder of George Floyd in May 2020 sparked nationwide protests over racial injustice.\n\nVavra was fired in April 2021, and sued Honeywell eight months later. A trial judge dismissed the lawsuit in August 2023. Wednesday's decision upheld that dismissal.\n\nThe case is Vavra v. Honeywell International Inc, 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 23-2823.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A rally in the world\u2019s largest technology companies sent stocks to all-time highs, with Jerome Powell\u2019s remarks to Congress not doing much to dissuade traders from betting on Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat The End of the Cheap Money Era Catches Up to Chelsea FC\u2019s Owner Distressed Property Buyers Seek Out \u2018Exceptional Bargains\u2019 Microsoft, Apple Drop OpenAI Board Plans as Scrutiny Grows NYC Penthouse Sells for $135 Million in Priciest Deal Since 2022\n\nFor the first time in its history, the S&P 500 topped 5,600. A renewed bid for megacaps drove the gauge toward its longest win since November, with Nvidia Corp. up 2.5% and Apple Inc. climbing on news it aims to ship 10% more new iPhones after a bumpy 2023. Treasuries remained fairly stable after a strong $39 billion sale of 10-year bonds. Swaps are pricing in two Fed cuts in 2024 \u2014 and higher chances the first comes in September.\n\nAs Wall Street geared up for the consumer-price index, Powell said the Fed doesn\u2019t need inflation below 2% before cutting rates, while adding officials still have more work to do. He noted the labor market has cooled \u201cpretty significantly.\u201d Powell cited a \u201cgood ways to go\u201d on the balance-sheet runoff, and said commercial real estate doesn\u2019t threaten financial stability.\n\n\u201cThe key takeaway from his testimony is the Fed\u2019s assessment of the balance of risks is shifting in ways that \u2013 if supported and sustained by incoming data \u2013 will deliver a rate cut in September,\u201d said Krishna Guha at Evercore.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed for a seventh straight day, while the Nasdaq 100 added 1%. Gold and silver mining stocks rallied on Fed easing bets. Banks underperformed. Google parent Alphabet Inc. has shelved efforts to acquire HubSpot Inc., according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nUS 10-year yields fell two basis points to 4.28%. Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill said the timing of a rate cut is still an \u201copen question,\u201d prompting traders to pare bets on August cut. Oil rose as a US holiday boosted demand for gasoline and jet fuel.\n\n\u201cMarkets remain remarkably calm despite the flood of data this week, including Fed Chair Powell\u2019s testimony, CPI/PPI reports, and the beginning of earnings season,\u201d said Mark Hackett at Nationwide.\n\nThe so-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs and is seen as a better measure of underlying inflation, is expected to rise 0.2% in June for a second month. That would mark the smallest back-to-back gains since August \u2014 a pace more palatable for Fed officials.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cJune\u2019s CPI report looks to be another \u2018very good\u2019 report that should boost the FOMC\u2019s confidence about the inflation trajectory,\u201d said Anna Wong at Bloomberg Economics. \u201cThat should set the stage for the Fed to start cutting rates in September.\u201d\n\nA survey conducted by 22V Research shows 55% of investors expect the market reaction Thursday\u2019s CPI to be \u201crisk-on,\u201d 16% said \u201crisk-off\u201d and 29% \u201cmixed/negligible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is optimism about inflation generally,\u201d said Dennis DeBusschere at 22V, adding that the survey also showed investors think \u201cCPI is on a Fed-friendly glide path.\u201d\n\nMeantime, some trading desks say investors should gear up for a potential break in the eerie calm that\u2019s recently descended on the market.\n\nThe options market is betting the S&P 500 Index will move 0.8% in either direction after Thursday\u2019s report on consumer prices, based on the price of that day\u2019s at-the-money straddles, according to Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup\u2019s head of US equity trading strategy.\n\nIf it happens, that would be the biggest move for the index since June 12, the day of the last CPI print and interest-rate decision.\n\nMarket volatility may pick up in the days and weeks ahead, amid US political uncertainty, comments from the Fed chair, and the start of the second-quarter earnings season, according to Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nFor the first time since 2022, S&P 500 earnings may not be laser-focused on just technology, with the quarter\u2019s success hanging on everything aside from the megacap tech heavyweights that have driven stocks to all-time highs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.\n\n\u201cWhile forecasts for the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 remain robust, their earnings are expected to slow in the second quarter \u2014 just as the rest of the S&P 500 may finally post their first year-on-year growth in at least five quarters,\u201d they noted.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven may have already peaked, while the remaining S&P 500 stocks may post their first earnings expansion in at least six quarters, the strategists concluded.\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nMicrosoft Corp. has avoided the threat of a lengthy European Union antitrust probe into its cloud business after it brokered a deal with an Amazon.com Inc.-backed trade lobby that had complained about its software license agreements. Intuit Inc. is cutting 1,800 employees, swapping out low performers and executives with fresh hires meant to sharpen the company\u2019s focus on products that use artificial intelligence. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. agreed to buy Silo AI for $665 million in cash, adding a maker of artificial intelligence models that will help its push to close the gap on Nvidia Corp. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. \u2014 working to put an accounting scandal behind it \u2014 hired a 3M Co. executive to oversee its finances and help restore its credibility with shareholders. The US Federal Trade Commission is preparing a lawsuit against the three largest drug middlemen over their use of rebates for insulin and other drugs, according to a person familiar with the probe. Honeywell International Inc. agreed to buy Air Products and Chemicals Inc.\u2019s liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment business for $1.81 billion in cash.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nUS CPI, initial jobless claims, Thursday Fed\u2019s Raphael Bostic and Alberto Musalem speak, Thursday China trade, Friday University of Michigan consumer sentiment, US PPI, Friday Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo\u2019s earnings, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.8% as of 2:52 p.m. New York time The Nasdaq 100 rose 1% The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% The MSCI World Index rose 0.8%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro rose 0.1% to $1.0825 The British pound rose 0.5% to $1.2844 The Japanese yen fell 0.3% to 161.76 per dollar\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin fell 0.6% to $57,573.71 Ether rose 1% to $3,101.74\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.28% Germany\u2019s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 2.53% Britain\u2019s 10-year yield declined three basis points to 4.13%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 1% to $82.26 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.4% to $2,372.91 an ounce\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Cecile Gutscher, Richard Henderson, Joel Leon and Jessica Menton.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era The First Porsche 911 Hybrid Is $165,000 Carrera GTS: Review\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Adjusted earnings per share, which is defined as diluted earning per share adjusted to exclude pension mark-to-market expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, certain acquisition-related costs, and other items as described in\u00a0reconciliations provided when we disclose adjusted earnings per share; and EBITDA, which we define as earnings before tax, depreciation and amortization.\n\nManagement believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends.\n\nManagement does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in the consolidated financials statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nAbout Air Products Air Products (NYSE:APD) is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 80 years focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets.
