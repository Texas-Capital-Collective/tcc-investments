        "content": "Electric vehicle sales are accelerating again, creating an opportunity for some of the top EV stocks to buy.\n\nIn California, for example, about\u00a024% of all new cars sold were electric in the first quarter, according to the California Energy Commission. The state recently approved about $1.9 billion to build 40,000 new public EV chargers to help fuel adoption.\n\nAs for the rest of the country, \u201cSix of the 10 biggest EV makers in the US saw sales grow at a scorching pace compared to a year ago,\u201d\u00a0says Bloomberg.\u00a0Even better,\u00a0\u201cFor the rest of 2024, GM appears to be on the brink of becoming the biggest driver of EV growth in the US.\u00a0The Detroit automaker has committed to electrifying some of its biggest brands,\u00a0which arefinally reaching production after years of delays.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe International Energy Agency\u00a0also\u00a0expects US deliveries to top\u00a02.5 million by 2025 from about 1.1 million in 2024. In short, demand is on the run.\n\nWith that,\u00a0here are some of the top EV stocks to buy that should accelerate with better sales.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center.

Granted, sales have slipped but it\u2019s still dominating the market.\u201d\n\nThat was on May 20, as Tesla traded at about $175. Today, it\u2019s up to $191.08, which is still an attractive buy, especially with EV sales regaining momentum. From that last traded price, I\u2019d like to see Tesla initially retest $205.\n\nHelping,\u00a0Wedbush analysts say the $56 billion Elon Musk compensation removes a $20 to $25 overhang on the TSLA stock. That\u2019s because the award now dispels fears Musk will focus on other projects outside of Tesla, including a generative artificial intelligence project. With this, Wedbush has a $275 price target on TSLA shares.\n\nPlus, Tesla\u2019s market dominance is only expected to become stronger.\n\nAs noted by QZ.com, \u201cWhile Tesla was out selling 50,000 new EVs, Ford was struggling to hit 10,000 EVs sold in second place. Behind it was\u00a0Hyundai, which shifted 5,686\u00a0electric cars in March and BMW sold 4,246 electric models.\u201d\n\nBYD Co.

(OTCMKTS:BYDDF), it traded at $24 on May 22.\n\nAt the time I noted, \u201cFrom its last traded price of $28, I\u2019d like to see it break above prior resistance at $32 a share. The company noted passenger vehicle sales were up 23.64% YTD to 936,446, with electric sales up about 18% to 434,579.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNow up to $29.05, it\u2019s still a buy.\n\nAnalysts at\u00a0Citi just opened a 30-day upside catalyst watch on the BYD stock with lower-than-feared European Union tariffs and\u00a0stronger\u00a0domestic demand.\n\n\u201cThe lower tariff bodes well for BYD\u2019s market share gain in the EU, Citibank analysts said. They also forecast that BYD\u2019s exports to the EU will account for one-fourth to one-third of its overall sales in 2024,\u201d\u00a0added Investint.com. \u201cThe brokerage also flagged strength in domestic sales, with BYD seeing strong order intake in recent weeks, which heralds stronger sales in the second and third quarter.\u201d\n\nGlobal X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) White electric car connected to power station charger on green background 3D Rendering. Electric vehicles, EVs, EV stocks.\n\nSource: Ilija Erceg / Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you want greater exposure to autonomous and other top EV stocks\u00a0to buy at less cost, there\u2019s the\u00a0Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV).\n\nThe last time I highlighted an opportunity in the DRIV ETF, it traded at $23.22 in April. Now at $24.08, it\u2019s still a buy.\n\nFrom here, if EV sales momentum can improve, if we see more charging stations installed, and if the Federal Reserve does cut interest rates, electric vehicle stocks and ETFs, like DRIV, could accelerate to higher highs. In addition, with an expense ratio of 0.68%, the ETF currently\u00a0invests in 45 stocks involved in the development of autonomous vehicle technology, electric vehicles and EV components and materials.\n\nSome of its top 75 fund holdings include\u00a0Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Toyota(NYSE:TM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), Stellantis(NYSE:STLA) and Honda Motor (NYSE:HMC)\u00a0to name a few.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.
