You can skip our detailed discussion and go directly to 5 Most Profitable Industries in the US in 2024.\n\nAn Outlook of the US Economy & its Impact on Business\n\nOnly recently markets in the United States witnessed unprecedented downturns amid fears over a possible recession. The unemployment rate in the United States reached 4% in May, the highest in over two years. On August 2, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the unemployment rate in the United States grew to 4.3% in July, adding only 114,000 jobs during the month. Temporary layoffs in the United States reached 1.1 million in July and the head count for long-term unemployed individuals was 1.5 million. As the unemployment rate in the US continues to rise, the risk of an impending recession looms over the economy deterring investor confidence.\n\nThe fears of a declining economy were aggravated as probable rate cuts by the Fed were delayed to the last quarter of 2024. On August 16, Reuters reported that the Fed is expected to deliver a rate cut next month in September. Experts predict that the rate cut will ease inflationary pressures. As per the rate cut expectations, consensus opinions hint towards a quarter to half-point cut, and a 30 basis point cut in the future. While the US economy is not officially in a recession, the quarterly real GDP growth expectation collapsed to 1.5% from over 4% in May, as of July 5, according to Reuters.\n\nThe impact of uncertain macroeconomic conditions on consumer spending and business outlook has been immense. On May 30, Reuters reported that the US economy experienced sluggish growth in the first quarter, unable to meet expectations. Between January and March, GDP expanded by only 1.3%, down from the previously estimated 1.6%. The report suggests that high interest rates to cool the economy have led to declines in consumer spending, which were revised down to an annualized rate of 2%. Corporate profits declined by 0.6%, after reaching a record high in the last quarter of 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO\n\n10 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100 and\n\n7 Best Canadian Stocks Under $20.\n\nThe Company Driving the Most Profitable Industries\n\nDespite macroeconomic challenges, some industries have been performing immensely well. The software applications and semiconductor industries are some of the most profitable industries in the United States. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) calls itself the \u201cEngine of AI\u201d as it pioneers the hardware and software for AI, such as semiconductors and AI applications. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) not only designs and produces graphics processing units (GPUs), but it also provides cloud products to enterprises.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company currently holds a 95% market share of data center GPUs and 80% of the market share of AI accelerators. It reported $22.6 billion in data center revenue in Q1 2024, up by 23% from the previous quarter and 427% from a year ago. Compute and networking revenue drove data center revenue, growing by 5x and 3x than the previous year.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expanding its footprint in the AI and robotics industry by forming strategic partnerships with other tech giants. In the first quarter of 2024, the company launched optimizations across NVIDIA\u2019s data center in collaboration with Google. Figure, a robotics startup, trained on Nvidia's GPUs, announced the launch of its next-generation humanoid robot on August 8. The new robot has ultimate computing power, allowing it to perform human tasks autonomously.\n\nOverall, NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) role in harnessing technology is crucial to the US economy. Currently, the company provides chips to 95% of the market and is in the works of launching a new batch that also runs the company's software infrastructure. Now transformed into an AI company, Nvidia is powering through to add another $15 trillion to the US economy.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some cheaper AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.
