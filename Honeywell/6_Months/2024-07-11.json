        "title": "Honeywell (HON) to Acquire Air Products' LNG Process Business",
        "content": "Honeywell International Inc. HON has inked a deal to acquire Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\u2019s APD liquefied natural gas (LNG) process technology and equipment business for $1.81 billion in cash. This marks Honeywell\u2019s fourth acquisition announcement so far this year.\r\n\r\nHON\u2019s shares gained 1.9% yesterday to eventually close the trading session at $214.49.\r\n\r\nBased in Pennsylvania, Air Products is engaged in producing atmospheric gases, process gases and specialty gases for customers in various industries, including refining, chemical, manufacturing, electronics, energy production, medical, food and metals. Its LNG technology and equipment business is based in Allentown, PA, and currently employs about 475 people.\n\nAcquisition Rationale\n\nThe latest buyout is in sync with Honeywell\u2019s policy of acquiring businesses to strengthen its business and expand its market share. The inclusion of LNG process technology and equipment business expertise in in-house design and manufacturing of coil-wound heat exchangers and related equipment portfolio will boost HON\u2019s energy transition portfolio. This acquisition will enable Honeywell to offer a comprehensive solution for its customers\u2019 energy transformation needs.\r\n\r\nHON's energy transition solution will include natural gas pre-treatment and advanced liquefaction that leverages advanced digital automation technologies within the Honeywell Forge and Experion platforms. This all-in-one solution will facilitate its customers in managing natural gas assets easily and efficiently.\r\n\r\nSubject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the acquisition is expected to close before the end of 2024. The company expects the buyout to be accretive to its revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share in the first full year of possession.\n\nOther Notable Buyouts\n\nAcquisitions are an essential aspect of Honeywell's growth strategy. In June 2024, the company inked a deal to acquire CAES Systems Holdings LLC from private equity firm Advent International for about $1.9 billion in cash. The transaction will augment HON's defense technology offerings across various domains, including land, sea, air and space.\r\n\r\nIn the same month, HON acquired Carrier\u2019s Global Access Solutions business for an all-cash deal of $4.95 billion. The inclusion of Global Access Solutions\u2019 expertise in advanced access and security solutions, coupled with its impressive growth and margin profile, will enable Honeywell to expand its security products portfolio and boost its building automation segment. In March 2024, HON announced its plan to purchase Civitanavi Systems S.p.A. for about \u20ac200 million ($217 million) to boost its portfolio of aerospace navigation solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank and Price Performance\n\nHoneywell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has risen 2.7% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 10.6% growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrength in the commercial aviation, building automation and UOP businesses augurs well for Honeywell. A strong commercial aftermarket and solid commercial aviation demand led by strength in the air transport aftermarket are aiding the Aerospace segment.\r\n\r\nHowever, HON\u2019s Industrial Automation segment remains notably weak due to lower volumes in the warehouse and workflow solutions business. High costs and expenses, owing to an increase in material and labor costs, may affect its margins and profitability.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked companies from the Conglomerates sector are discussed below:\r\n\r\nCarlisle Companies Incorporated CSL presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 17%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSL\u2019s 2024 earnings has increased 2.2% in the past 60 days. Shares of Carlisle have gained 57.9% in the past year.\r\n\r\nGriffon Corporation GFF presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. It delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 33.5%.\r\n\r\nIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for GFF\u2019s 2024 earnings has increased 4.2%. The stock has risen 52.6% in the past year.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. APD announced that Honeywell International Inc. HON will acquire APD's liquefied natural gas (LNG) process technology and equipment business for $1.81 billion in an all-cash transaction. This represents approximately 13 times the estimated 2024 EBITDA.\n\nThis acquisition will enable Honeywell to provide a comprehensive, top-tier solution for managing energy transformation. The new offering will include natural gas pre-treatment and advanced liquefaction, integrated with Honeywell's Forge and Experion digital automation platforms.

The LNG business is at its peak, thanks to a dedicated team, and will thrive under Honeywell's portfolio.\n\nThe LNG market has quadrupled in the past 20 years and is projected to double over the next two decades, driven by demand in key sectors like power and data centers, according to industry research.\n\nHoneywell mentioned that integrating this talented team and proprietary technologies will allow Honeywell UOP to offer scalable solutions and services to help global customers transition to more sustainable and efficient energy practices.\n\nAir Products' LNG business has about 475 employees, headquartered in Allentown, PA, with a 390,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Port Manatee, FL, where CWHEs of all sizes are produced.\n\nThis acquisition is Honeywell's fourth this year as part of its capital deployment strategy, focusing on high-return acquisitions aligned with the megatrends of automation, aviation, and energy transition. The transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year of ownership, with no financing conditions. It is anticipated to close by the end of the year, pending customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\n\nStory continues\n\nAPD\u2019s shares have lost 13.1% in the past year compared with a 13.5% fall in the\u00a0industry.

        "title": "Honeywell CEO\u2019s $1.8 billion LNG deal is his fourth acquisition in eight months",
        "content": "Good morning.\n\nThe energy transition is a battle fought through electrons and molecules. We want green electrons, electricity generated by wind, sun, or waves instead of, say, coal. And we want to store energy in green molecules such as ethanol, hydrogen, or ones made from food waste. I recently boarded a Japan Airlines flight that was powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) created from used cooking oil. Fry to fly!\n\nHoneywell CEO and chairman Vimal Kapur thinks a lot about green molecules. His company is a pioneer in the technology that produces SAF. As Kapur recently told me: \u201cYou can\u2019t run a plane on electricity.\u201d (Not yet, perhaps, although Germany\u2019s H2FLY conducted the world\u2019s first piloted flight of an electric aircraft powered by liquid hydrogen.) That\u2019s why he has Honeywell focused on creating SAF and carbon-free molecules like green hydrogen as part of the solution in achieving the energy transition.\n\nIt's not the only area where Honeywell plays. Since taking the top job last year, Kapur has aligned the industrial giant\u2019s portfolio around automation, the future of aviation, and the energy transition. Yesterday, Honeywell announced the acquisition of Air Products\u2019 liquefied natural gas (LNG) process technology and equipment business for $1.8 billion. It\u2019s his fourth major acquisition in eight months. While LNG isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call clean energy, it produces fewer carbon dioxide emissions than coal and oil, which makes it an important bridge in what Kapur calls the decarbonization journey.\n\nHoneywell can also use LNG to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide, the latter of which it can capture, liquefy, and ship to oil companies that can reuse it. The issue isn\u2019t just the technology but the cost: making it feasible for others to do the right thing. \u201cThe energy transition is not easy and it\u2019s not cheap,\u201d said Kapur. \u201cWe are solving economic problems.\u201d\n\nCreating a business case around the move to a low-carbon economy is the essence of sustainability. If you\u2019re looking to share your approach and learn from others, consider joining the Fortune Impact Initiative, held in conjunction with our partners at EVERFI from Blackbaud. We will meet on Oct. 8 and 9 in Atlanta for conversations led by Kristin Stoller and my other newsroom colleagues.
