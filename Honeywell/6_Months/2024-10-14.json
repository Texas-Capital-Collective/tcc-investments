        "content": "PHOENIX, Oct. 14, 2024  /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) has been awarded a $103 million contract by the U.S. Army, through the Defense Logistics Agency, to provide its Next-Generation APN-209 Radar Altimeter (Next Gen APN-209) system on a wide variety of Army aircraft. This contract underscores Honeywell's ongoing commitment to delivering advanced, reliable technology to support U.S. Army missions. It also supports Honeywell's alignment of its portfolio to three powerful megatrends, including the future of aviation. (PRNewsfoto/Honeywell)\n\nHoneywell's new APN-209 Radar Altimeter system is a direct replacement for its legacy APN-209, which has been the primary radar altimeter on numerous U.S. Army aircraft since its introduction in 1975. This modernized system offers several key enhancements:\n\nHigher reliability and environmental performance: The Next Gen APN-209 is engineered to operate with greater reliability and superior performance in challenging weather conditions. Advanced common-core architecture: Utilizing Honeywell's common-core radar altimeter architecture from its civil radar altimeter portfolio, the Next Gen APN-209 addresses risks associated with supply chain disruptions, component obsolescence and long-term repair support, improving sustained operational readiness. Flexible integration options: The system is available with an integrated altitude indicator or as a standalone transceiver for aircraft that utilize separate displays, offering versatility to meet various aircraft requirements.\n\n\"We are honored to continue our support of the U.S. Army with the Next Gen APN-209 Radar Altimeter system,\" said Matt Milas, President of Defense and Space at Honeywell Aerospace Technologies. \"The introduction of our Next Gen APN-209 underscores our decades-long commitment to providing cutting-edge technology that enhances the safety, reliability, and operational capability of military aircraft. Our new advanced radar altimeter system will not only enable us to further support the Army's mission success, but it will also be a capability we intend to extend, where permissible, to our international customers in the coming years.\"\n\nHoneywell has a longstanding reputation as the primary altimeter supplier to the U.S. Department of Defense, with more than 150,000 delivered over the past 60 years. Honeywell has supplied its legacy altimeters to many international customers and expects to introduce the Next Gen APN-209 in international markets in the years to come.\n\nAbout Honeywell Products and services from Honeywell Aerospace Technologies\u00a0are found on virtually every commercial, defense and space aircraft.
