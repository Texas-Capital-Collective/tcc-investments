        "title": "Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",
        "content": "Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 25, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.6%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $9.4 billion, up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.48% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Honeywell International?\n\nFor Honeywell International, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.38%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Honeywell International will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Honeywell International would post earnings of $2.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.25, delivering a surprise of +3.21%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nHoneywell International doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nCarlisle (CSL), another stock in the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $5.72 for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +10.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.41 billion, down 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Carlisle has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -3.44%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Carlisle will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
