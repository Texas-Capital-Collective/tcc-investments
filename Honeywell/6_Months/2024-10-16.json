Let\u2019s take a look at how general industrial machinery stocks fared in Q1, starting with Luxfer (NYSE:LXFR).\n\nAutomation that increases efficiency and connected equipment that collects analyzable data have been trending, creating new demand for general industrial machinery companies. Those who innovate and create digitized solutions can spur sales and speed up replacement cycles, but all general industrial machinery companies are still at the whim of economic cycles.
