        "content": "Tuesday, July 23, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q2 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including S&P Global Inc. (SPGI), Honeywell International Inc. (HON) and Elevance Health, Inc. (ELV), as well a micro-cap stock Sypris Solutions, Inc. (SYPR). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding this morning's releases from Coke, UPS, GM and others, we now have Q2 results from 103 S&P 500 members or 20.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +6.8% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues, with 82.5% beating EPS estimates and 59.2% beating revenue estimates.\n\nComparing the Q2 results from these companies relative to what we had seen from the same group of 103 companies in other recent periods, we find\n\n- The Q2 EPS beats percentage of 82.5% compares to 79.6% in each of the preceding two periods and the average for the preceding 20-quarters (5 years) of 79.8%.\n\n- The Q2 revenue beats percentage of 59.2% compares to 66% and 68% for this group of 103 index members in 2024 Q1 and 2023 Q4, respectively. The 20-quarter average for this group of companies is 70.6%. This means that companies continue to struggle to beat revenue estimates.\n\n- With respect to the growth rates, the earnings growth rate of +6.8% for this group of 103 companies is up from +6.3% in 2024 Q1, -0.7% in 2023 Q4, +2.5% in 2023 Q3, +0.4% in 2023 Q2 and so on. In other words, an accelerating growth trend on the earnings front.\n\n- With respect to revenues, the Q2 revenue growth rate of +3.5% is down from +4% in 2024 Q1, +3.1% in 2023 Q4, +4.5% in 2023 Q3 and so on.\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are expected to be up +9.2% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, which will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in 2022 Q1.\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nS&P Global shares have outperformed the Zacks Business - Information Services industry over the past year (+15.3% vs. +12.8%). The company remains well-poised to gain from the growing demand for business information services. Buyouts help innovate, increase differentiated content and develop new products. \r\n\r\nNew service launches have been aiding the company's growth. Dividend payments and share buybacks boost investors' confidence and positively impact earnings per share.\r\n\r\nHowever, S&P Global remains vulnerable to proceedings, investigations and inquiries concerning the ratings provided, leading to legal charges, damages or fines. Growth initiatives, higher compensations and incentives raise the company's expenses.t\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on S&P Global here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Honeywell have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the year-to-date period (+3.3% vs. -4.4%). The company\u2019s strength in the commercial aviation, building automation and UOP businesses augurs well. The Aerospace segment is particularly strong, driven by robust demand in the aviation aftermarket. \r\n\r\nA strong commercial aftermarket and solid commercial aviation demand, led by strength in the air transport aftermarket, are aiding the Aerospace segment. Handsome rewards to shareholders add to the stock\u2019s appeal. The ability to generate strong free cash flow supports its shareholder-friendly activities.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s commercial and operational excellence initiatives, along with its pricing actions, enable it to maintain a healthy margin performance. While acquisitions have expanded its product range and geographic reach, they have increased Honeywell\u2019s balance sheet debt as well. Foreign currency translation remains an overhang.t\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Honeywell here >>>)\r\n\r\nElevance Health shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Services industry over the past year (+7.0% vs. +2.0%). The company beat earnings estimate by 1.3% in the second quarter. Its revenue growth, fueled by premium rate increases and rising memberships, contributes to its positive trajectory. \r\n\r\nStrategic acquisitions and partnerships have fortified its business portfolio. A robust Medicare Advantage segment, combined with successful contract acquisitions, is poised to drive future memberships. It reaffirmed the 2024 earnings guidance to $37.20 per share. The Carelon business is a key contributor to its success. ELV utilizes excess capital to boost shareholder value. \r\n\r\nHowever, its rising expenses continue to put pressure on margins. Its high balance sheet debt is reducing financial flexibility. Also, its declining free cash flow is a concern. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Elevance Health here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Sypris Solutions have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+3.8% vs. -8.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $42.81 million has secured a long-term, sole-source contract extension with a major commercial vehicle manufacturer for Ultra Axle Shafts, ensuring stable revenues and reinforcing its industry reputation. \r\n\r\nSypris Solutions\u2019 Sypris Electronics unit is also expanding in the electronic warfare market with additional U.S. Navy contracts, enhancing defense capabilities against threats. Sypris' strong position in the growing aerospace and defense electronics markets supports sustained revenue growth. Financial stability is bolstered by an improved cash balance. A significant backlog provides revenue visibility and supports financial planning. \r\n\r\nHowever, the company faces challenges with net losses widening to $2.2 million in Q1 2024 and reduced profit margins. Rising operating expenses, high debt levels and competitive pressures also pose risks.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Sypris Solutions here >>>)\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include American Tower Corporation (AMT), Cintas Corporation (CTAS) and TC Energy Corporation (TRP).\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\n\nStory continues\n\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "INDUSTRIAL AI UPTAKE IS JUST GETTING STARTED BUT MAJORITY OF SECTOR IS UNCOVERING NEW USE CASES, FINDS HONEYWELL RESEARCH",
        "content": "Workforce productivity, flexibility, and safety are cited as key gains from AI applications along with its potential to address the industrial skills shortage\n\nCHARLOTTE,\u00a0N.C., July 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON) today released the findings of its IndustrialAI Insights global\u00a0research study, which captures the state of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the sector. While only 17% of AI decision makers around the world have fully implemented their initial AI plans, more than 9 in 10 say they are uncovering unexpected new use cases whether they are in the prototyping, launch, or scaling stages of AI implementation.\n\nThe research also finds AI leaders are \"sold\" on AI for industrial applications. The enthusiasm for a deeper commitment to AI investment is nearly universal, with 94% of those surveyed saying they have plans to expand their utilization of AI.\n\n\"There is no question that AI is currently at a pivotal moment,\" said Kevin\u00a0Dehoff, Honeywell's Chief Strategy Officer. \"With the advent of Gen AI and more sources of data from advanced analytics, Industrial AI is poised to grow exponentially, and the possibilities are endless for revenue growth and employee satisfaction.\"\n\nAI Unlocks Workplace Benefits When asked for their thoughts on the impact of AI on industrials, nearly two-thirds (64%) of AI leaders cited efficiency and productivity gains among the most promising benefits. Sixty percent say improved cybersecurity and threat detection result from AI and 59% report better decision making due to real-time data generation. Top benefits cited by AI leaders of industrial AI\n\nSeveral other benefits of AI for workers were also cited by respondents, including:\n\nIncreased work flexibility (49%) Greater job satisfaction (45%) More time for skills development and creative thinking (44%) Increased workplace safety (39%)\n\nSkills development is crucial in today's economy with baby boomers retiring and fewer replacements entering the workforce. Through AI, employers can more quickly upskill and reskill workers. AI will transform industrials as it enables workers to perform jobs at higher levels, providing greater job satisfaction while increasing productivity and addressing the skills shortage.\n\nLucian Boldea, President and CEO of Honeywell Industrial Automation, offered one direct example: \"There can be tens of thousands of instruments, equipment, and valves needed to process and manufacture a product and many of the parts we supply manufacturers require highly experienced technicians for operation and maintenance \u2013 and there are fewer and fewer of those experienced technicians available. With AI training and AI as a \"co-pilot\" the skills of a less experienced technicians can more quickly be upgraded, turning them into more elite experts that perform tasks based on enterprise knowledge and best practices. In turn, plants' operations can run more safely and reliably by dramatically reducing human error.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's Next for AI While the enthusiasm for AI to expand is palpable, there are still some challenges in the way of full adoption. More than a third of survey respondents (37%) feel that their C-Suite fully doesn't understand how AI works and almost half (48%) say they are having to continually justify or request resources needed to implement AI plans.\n\n\"Businesses of all types recognize that AI is transforming our world and creating new possibilities. For building operations \u2013 such as hospitals, campuses, and offices \u2013 it is clearly the future. As AI orchestrates controls that regulate\u00a0HVAC, lighting and electricity usage, it helps to improve safety, operational and sustainability outcomes,\"\u00a0said Billal Hammoud, President and CEO of Honeywell Building Automation.\n\nAll of this suggests the pace of change will be driven by compelling use cases that can be measured in terms of improved business performance. As new solutions demonstrate clear benefits to workforce productivity, safety, and reliability, AI adoption will dramatically increase with the potential to transform industrial operations.\n\nTo learn more about the survey results and Honeywell's work in AI and automation, please visit\u00a0www.honeywell.com/us/en/ai/research.\n\nMethodology Honeywell commissioned Wakefield Research to survey AI leaders around the world.
