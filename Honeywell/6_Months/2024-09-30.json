        "title": "Honeywell Rewards Shareholders With 5% Dividend Increase",
        "content": "In a shareholder-friendly move, Honeywell International HON recently raised its quarterly dividend by approximately 5% to $1.13 per share (annually: $4.52). The new dividend will be paid on Dec. 6, 2024, to shareholders of record as of Nov. 15.\r\n\r\nThe latest dividend hike marks Honeywell\u2019s 15th consecutive raise since 2010. This underscores its sound financial health as it utilizes free cash flow to enhance shareholders\u2019 returns.\r\n\r\nIn the first six months of 2024, HON rewarded shareholders with $1.45 billion in dividends and $1.20 billion in share repurchases. Also, in 2023, it paid out dividends worth $2.86 billion and repurchased shares for $3.72 billion. It\u2019s worth noting that in the second quarter of 2024, HON generated a free cash flow of $1.11 billion. The company expects a free cash flow in the range of $5.5-$5.9 billion for 2024.\r\n\r\nApart from repurchasing shares and paying out dividends, Honeywell deploys its capital to make acquisitions. In September 2024, it acquired CAES Systems Holdings (\u201cCAES\u201d) from private equity firm Advent. The transaction will augment its defense technology offerings across various domains, including land, sea, air and space.\r\n\r\nAlso, in June 2024, the company acquired Carrier\u2019s Global Access Solutions business for an all-cash deal of $4.95 billion. The inclusion of Global Access Solutions\u2019 expertise in advanced access and security solutions, coupled with its impressive growth and margin profile, is enabling it to expand its security products portfolio and boost its building automation segment.\n\nHON\u2019s Zacks Rank & Price Performance\n\nHoneywell, with approximately $134.9 billion market capitalization, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company is set to gain from strength in commercial aviation and defense & space markets driven by solid demand for air travel and stable U.S. and international defense spend volumes. However, softness in its Industrial Automation segment remains a concern. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the past year, the company\u2019s shares have gained 13.7% compared with the industry\u2019s 21.3% growth.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $10.14 per share for 2024, indicating a decrease of a penny from the 30-day-ago figure.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked companies from the same space are discussed below.\r\n\r\nFederal Signal Corporation FSS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nFederal Signal delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 12.3%. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FSS\u2019 2024 earnings has been stable.\r\n\r\nVector Group Ltd. VGR presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 15.4%.\r\n\r\nIn the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for VGR\u2019s 2024 earnings has remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nCarlisle Companies Incorporated CSL currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. CSL delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 16.3%.\r\n\r\nIn the past 30 days, the consensus estimate for Carlisle\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has decreased by a penny.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "General Industrial Machinery Stocks Q2 In Review: Columbus McKinnon (NASDAQ:CMCO) Vs Peers\n\nThe end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let\u2019s take a look at how general industrial machinery stocks fared in Q2, starting with Columbus McKinnon (NASDAQ:CMCO).\n\nAutomation that increases efficiency and connected equipment that collects analyzable data have been trending, creating new demand for general industrial machinery companies. Those who innovate and create digitized solutions can spur sales and speed up replacement cycles, but all general industrial machinery companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies\u2019 offerings.\n\nThe 14 general industrial machinery stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 4% below.\n\nThe Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\ngeneral industrial machinery stocks have held steady amidst all this with average share prices relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.\n\nColumbus McKinnon (NASDAQ:CMCO)\n\nWith 19 different brands across the globe, Columbus McKinnon (NASDAQ:CMCO) offers material handling equipment for the construction, manufacturing, and transportation industries.\n\nColumbus McKinnon reported revenues of $239.7 million, up 1.8% year on year. This print was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, and overall, it was a satisfactory quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 operating margin estimates.\n\n\u201cWe executed solidly in the first quarter delivering continued sales growth and gross margin expansion while advancing our longer-term strategic objectives,\u201d said David J. Wilson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Columbus McKinnon Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 9.3% since reporting and currently trades at $35.57.\n\nIs now the time to buy Columbus McKinnon?

The business had an exceptional quarter with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 operating margin estimates and a solid beat of analysts\u2019 organic revenue estimates. 3M Total Revenue\n\nThe market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 32.7% since reporting. It currently trades at $137.18.\n\nIs now the time to buy 3M? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWeakest Q2: Hillenbrand (NYSE:HI)\n\nHillenbrand, Inc. (NYSE: HI) is an industrial company that designs, manufactures, and sells highly engineered processing equipment and solutions for various industries.\n\nHillenbrand reported revenues of $786.6 million, up 9.8% year on year, falling short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 3.9%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted full-year revenue guidance missing analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nHillenbrand delivered the weakest full-year guidance update in the group. As expected, the stock is down 25.6% since the results and currently trades at $28.30.\n\nRead our full analysis of Hillenbrand\u2019s results here.\n\nIcahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP)\n\nFounded in 1987, Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ: IEP) is a diversified holding company primarily engaged in investment and asset management across various sectors.\n\nIcahn Enterprises reported revenues of $2.55 billion, flat year on year. This result topped analysts\u2019 expectations by 13.9%.
