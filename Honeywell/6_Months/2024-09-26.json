        "content": "Honeywell International Inc. HON recently partnered with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM, to develop a Multi-Modal intelligent agent for Honeywell mobile devices. Powered by Qualcomm Technologies, the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven mobile assistant solution will boost workers\u2019 efficiency in distribution centers and retail industries.\r\n\r\nHON\u2019s shares lost 0.7% on the last trading day to eventually close the trading session at $206.8.\r\n\r\nBased in San Diego, CA, Qualcomm designs and manufactures semiconductors and telecommunications equipment. The company also focuses on areas like 5G connectivity, IoT (Internet of Things), automotive technology and AI, thereby enabling advanced capabilities across various applications and industries.\n\nInside the Headlines\n\nThis mobile assistant solution is a digital resource for the modern workforce, enabling workers to gain quick access to product information that enhances their efficiency by saving time and improving accuracy. Workers can input queries into the technology, such as stock availability or item location, to receive quick responses, which will be delivered through images, videos, voice responses or text. This will improve their productivity by allowing them to manage multiple tasks simultaneously. Workers will be able to use the solution through a software development kit, which can be integrated with an organization\u2019s prevailing applications and systems.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlong with enhancing workers\u2019 performance, the mobile assistant will help businesses improve their customer dealing capability. The Multi-Modal Intelligent Agent is anticipated to be launched early next year.\n\nHON\u2019s Zacks Rank\n\nStrength in the commercial aviation and building automation businesses augurs well for Honeywell. The Aerospace segment is particularly strong, driven by robust demand in the aviation aftermarket.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s shares have gained 10.1% compared with the industry\u2019s 10.3% growth.
