        "title": "3 Advanced Materials Stocks Shaping Tomorrow\u2019s Products",
        "content": "Although the media\u2019s attention is centered firmly on the output of the technology ecosystem, it may be prudent to consider the input. After all, every great work of art requires a canvas to provide the physical medium of expression. In this sense, investors should consider advanced materials stocks rather than only focusing on individual tech brands.\n\nPlease hear me out. I know this is the Internet so there\u2019s always room for misinterpretation. I\u2019m not suggesting that you abandon your approach to securing individual tech equities. Whether you\u2019re into artificial intelligence or automated mobility or anything in between, there\u2019s never been a better time to target the innovation industry.\n\nPlus, the key advantage of going the indirect route is that investors don\u2019t really know which specific company will succeed. However, all tech firms require advanced materials. Thus, while advanced materials stocks may be a boring idea, the concept is extremely relevant.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHoneywell (HON) Planning, analyzing indicators and buying and selling strategies, stock market, business growth, progress or success. Stocks to buy\n\nSource: NMStudio789 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest advanced materials stocks in the world, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) offers a compelling long-term investment for your portfolio. Primarily, the enterprise develops materials used in a wide range of industrial applications. As well, it brings to the table physical solutions for the electronics and aerospace sectors. Its high-performance fibers offer much relevancy in specialized fields such as thermal management.\n\nFinancially, the industrial conglomerate isn\u2019t exactly what you call an exciting play. However, it\u2019s dependable and consistent. In the past four quarters, Honeywell posted an average earnings per share of $2.36. This figure beat the collective consensus view of $2.30, yielding an earnings surprise of 2.85%.\n\nIn the trailing 12 months (TTM), Honeywell posted EPS of $8.63 on sales of $36.9 billion. By the end of this year, analysts project that EPS may rise 11.57% to $10.22. On the top line, sales could see a bump of 5.7% to $38.74 billion. Similar expansion for the top and bottom lines is expected in fiscal 2025. Combined with a forward yield of 1.98%, Honeywell is a strong candidate for advanced materials stocks to buy.\n\nDow (DOW) Keyboard with three keys reading \"buy,\" \"hold\" and \"sell\" in green, yellow and red\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Weitwinkel\n\nA top-tier enterprise in the specialty chemicals industry, Dow (NYSE:DOW) engages in the provision of various materials science solutions. Its products cover the needs of multiple sectors, including packaging, infrastructure, mobility and consumer applications. DOW ranks as one of the most relevant advanced materials stocks for its high-performance silicones, acrylics and polyurethanes.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with Honeywell above, Dow isn\u2019t exactly an exciting financial prospect. However, where it shines for investors is in its consistency. During the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of 56 cents. In contrast, the collective consensus view sat at 50 cents. Therefore, the performance yielded an earnings surprise of 12.03%, which is impressive considering the slow-moving sector.\n\nIn the TTM period, Dow posted EPS of $1.68 on revenue of $43.45 billion. By year\u2019s end, analysts anticipate a robust 30.36% expansion in the bottom line to $2.92 per share. On the top line, sales could dip slightly to $44.36 billion. However, the high-side estimate calls for growth of 2.64% to $45.8 billion.\n\nThe company provides a forward yield of 5.12%, making it an attractive idea for advanced materials stocks.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile an obvious idea for advanced materials stocks, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) nevertheless deserves special attention. As one of the top producers of lithium, the company will almost surely play a significant role in the technologies of tomorrow. Lithium-ion batteries are indispensable when it comes to portable electronic products. As the nature of mobility shifts toward electric vehicles, the underlying asset will become even more highly demanded.\n\nTo be fair, ALB stock encountered some rough waters. Since the beginning of this year, shares have slumped more than 33%. In the past 52 weeks, they\u2019re down nearly 59%. That said, some context is needed. In the past four quarters, the company posted EPS of $3.05. While not every quarter was a beat, the hits were so massive that the average beat the collective consensus view of $2.43.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the valuation. Right now, shares trade at 1.37X trailing-year sales. Between the first quarters of 2023 and 2024, this metric stood at 2.39X. To clarify, analysts do see a severe drop of 40% in sales to $5.79 billion this year. However, a recovery effort may start in fiscal 2025, when sales reach $6.86 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Quantum Computing Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers in the Making: July Edition",
        "content": "Quantum computing is still relatively new which means that there is a lot of opportunity when it comes to quantum computing stocks.\n\nAdvancements in quantum computing technology such as the superconducting qubits and the trapped ion technology have boosted the efficiency and effectiveness of quantum systems. It is an interesting fact that organizations are gradually proving quantum supremacy and useful tasks for quantum computers. These are important for moving from the proof-of-concept stage to that of commercialization which can greatly increase the appeal of quantum computing stocks.\n\nIt is apparent that quantum computing is becoming more and more implemented in different fields. It is applied in financial services for portfolio management as well as identifying fraud. In the healthcare industry, quantum computing helps in drug discovery and in the development of personalized medicine. Further, fields like logistics and material science are using quantum computing for optimization issues and new material creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI strongly feel that given the broad application base for quantum computing, there will be some quantum computing stocks that could be multi-baggers in the making. So here are seven companies for investors to consider.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) IONQ logo\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is a quantum computing company that is absolutely advancing in its efforts to get its technology to the market. The trapped ion qubits used in the company\u2019s design have several benefits such as longer coherence times and the ability to easily increase the number of qubits. IonQ has already shown case use of its quantum computing potential in working with entities like DESY and Oak Ridge National Lab on problems in airport management and power grid transformation.\n\nAs of now the company is in its early commercial phase and has difficulties in generating profits and increasing its size, however, the recent achievements such as the 36-qubit system and the plans to create a 64-qubit one by 2025 are promising. Thus, IonQ has a solid cash balance and ongoing technical developments, which make it ready to meet the increasing commercial interest in quantum computing approaches.\n\nHowever, given IONQ\u2019s tiny market cap of just 1.89 billion, I think there\u2019s the potential for it to also double or triple in value, especially as commercialization heats up.\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI)\n\nSource: Bartlomiej K. Wroblewski / Shutterstock.com\n\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI)\u00a0 is a company that I am confident has a massive edge in the quantum computing business. Having obtained 165 patents and cooperating with such research centers as Oak Ridge National Lab, Rigetti should be able to seize the huge long-term value of quantum computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough the company is spending money to support its rapid R&D, I like the contract wins it has secured and the commencement of the sales of its 9-qubit Novera QPU. I believe that as the field of quantum computing continues to develop further, the technological advantage that Rigetti has, and the fact that it is one of the pioneers in the field will lead to increasing revenues and market share.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, RGTI also looks attractively priced. It has a market cap of just 204.58 million and trades at only 15x sales.\n\nD-Wave Quantum (QBTS) A digital rendering of a circuit board and digital chip in neon colors to illustrate quantum computing\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI am bullish on D-Wave Quantum (NYSE:QBTS) because as far as I am concerned they are leading the race when it comes to quantum computing. D-Wave is the sole supplier of quantum annealing computers (QAs) for commercial use which gives it an edge over its competitors. Of its latest Advantage2 system, the company claims that it has more than 1,200 qubits, thus making it the \u201cworld\u2019s largest quantum computer.\u201d\n\nD-Wave has solved practical problems and did that better than the current leading supercomputers. This has led to more business adoption as seen in the cases of Pattison Food Group and Ford Otosan which have incorporated D-Wave\u2019s solutions to enhance their logistics and business operations.\n\nFor these reasons, if D-Wave\u2019s management can execute the right strategies, I believe that the company could offer high returns to long-term investors. It also currently trades at a discount, with shares down 48.25% over the past year.\n\nQuantum Computing (QUBT) IBM Q System One Quantum Computer at the Consumer Electronic Show CES 2020. Quantum computing stocks.\n\nSource: Boykov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeing a full-stack quantum computing company, Quantum Computing (NASDAQ:QUBT) has a unique value proposition that is not present in the competitors\u2019 strategies.\n\nThe company\u2019s leading offering, Qatalyst, enables organizations to apply quantum methods for optimization to problems that can be solved with quantum or classical computing. QUBT\u2019s non-hardware-oriented approach and the aim of providing quantum computing as a service definitely puts the company in a good position as the technology evolves.\n\nNew achievements like the 5-20-fold improvement in quantum computing from QAmplify, and the acquisition of the quantum photonics company QPhoton display QUBT\u2019s innovation. Combined with the recent collaborations with such industry giants this makes QUBT one of those quantum computing stocks to buy.\n\nQUBT also has one of the smallest market capitalizations on this list of quantum computing stocks at just 63.85 million.\n\nAeva Technologies (AEVA) Mobile phone with logo of American autonomous driving company Aeva Inc. on screen in front of business web page. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nI like Aeva Technologies (NYSE:AEVA) because I think the company has all the right cards to play in the current trends of quantum computing and industrial robotics.\n\nThe company specializes in producing advanced sensor technologies, which is an essential component of quantum computing research and development. My view is that AEVA will grow in value as more competitors enter the market and as capital expenditure ramps up.\n\nFurthermore, Aeva\u2019s cooperation with Daimler Truck to apply LiDAR sensors for self-driving Class 8 trucks shows Aeva\u2019s technological advantage and the possibilities for the company\u2019s products to be used in the commercial vehicle sector.\n\nAEVA is a penny stock, so it naturally has multi-bagger potential. Analysts seem to be very bullish on it nonetheless, with triple-digit revenue and EPS forecasts on the horizon for the company.\n\nMargins for AEVA have also been improving over time, so I suspect that it has a reasonable chance of doubling in value in the foreseeable future.\n\nBruker Corporation (BRKR) Bruker sign and logo at office of manufacturer of scientific instruments for molecular and materials research company\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nI feel positive about Bruker (NASDAQ:BRKR) since it is in the process of shifting from a slow-growing company to a fast-growing company in high-value analytical technologies. Namely, it specializes in scientific instruments. This means that AEVA, and BRKR supply the \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d to allow for the quantum computing industry to grow and develop.\n\nBruker\u2019s revenue in 2023 was slightly above $3 billion with above-average double-digit growth from the organic standpoint, which confirms the high market demand for Bruker\u2019s instruments in numerous industries including life sciences, semiconductors, and energy.\n\nOne might find these companies more palatable to one\u2019s risk tolerance if they are concerned about the high runway of quantum computing\u2019s commercialization process. BRKR also has a diversified earnings stream from multiple clients in different industries, which could reduce risk. Although it has a 9 billion dollar market cap, it trades at just 3x sales, which means it may be potentially undervalued at its current price point and could have multi-bagger potential.\n\nHoneywell International (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nI feel it\u2019s crucial for companies to reinvent themselves in order to stay ahead of the curve. That is why I like Honeywell International (NASDAQ:HON). This company is going through a strategic shift to become one of the leading diversified industrial corporations with a focus on high-growth areas, including quantum computing.\n\nAlthough HON currently has a large amount of debt on its balance sheet at $25.26 billion via the numerous acquisitions it has made over the years, I expect the company to continue to reduce its net leverage ratio over the medium to long term. The secular growth opportunities such as data center cooling, AI-driven semiconductors, and energy transition create a multiyear opportunity for the company\u2019s revenue to grow at a faster rate and get its balance sheet back on track.\n\nHON may also be a good pick for people who are uncomfortable putting all their eggs in one basket when it comes to quantum computing, due to the speculative and uncertain nature of the technology. But it still reserves quantum as a potentially rewarding growth tailwind, making it one of those quantum computing stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
