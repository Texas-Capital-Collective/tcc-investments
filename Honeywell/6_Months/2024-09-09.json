        "content": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 10 Hottest Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) stands against Jim Cramer\u2019s other hot stock picks.\n\nIn a recent post of Jim Cramer\u2019s Morning Thoughts, he highlighted the impact of recent economic data on market sentiment. The S&P 500 is poised to fall for the fourth day in a row, following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. The report revealed that the U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs last month, falling short of the Dow Jones estimate of 161,000.\n\n\u201cThe S&P 500 is tracking for a fourth straight day of declines after the highly anticipated August jobs report came up short. Bond yields also moved lower on the report. The U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs in August, less than the Dow Jones estimate of 161,000, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2% as expected.\u201d Cramer said.\n\nDespite this shortfall, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2%, aligning with predictions. Additionally, the job gains for June and July were revised downwards. As a result, traders are now split between anticipating a standard 25 basis point interest rate cut and a more substantial 50 basis point reduction at the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming meeting on September 18.\n\n\u201cJob gains in the June and July reports were also revised down Friday. Traders were split roughly evenly between a traditional 25 basis point interest rate cut and a larger 50 basis point reduction at the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting on Sept. 18.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe Got What We Wanted, But the Market Crashed\u201d\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed how September 6 turned out to be a disappointing trading day. Despite hopes from bullish investors for a weak non-farm payrolls report that would encourage the Federal Reserve to cut rates, the actual report met these expectations.\n\n\u201cWhat an ugly day. Just hideous. We came into today knowing we\u2019d have a critical non-farm payrolls report. If you were a bull, you wanted to see weaker-than-expected hiring with wages pretty much in line, because that\u2019s what the Fed needs to see before it can start cutting rates. Voila, we got exactly what we wished for. Maybe we should have been careful, though, because as soon as we got what we wanted, the bulls vanished and the sellers came out of the woodwork, crushing practically everything.\u201d Said Cramer.\n\nJim Cramer pointed out that September is historically a weak month for the market due to significant profit-taking. Although it might seem circular to link September\u2019s weakness to profit-taking, it\u2019s more reasonable than attributing it solely to fears of a severe economic slowdown. Cramer emphasized that, despite the market\u2019s dips, big tech companies, especially those involved in key trends like data centers and accelerated computing\u2014should be considered as buying opportunities during these times.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis market has a September problem. Come September, we\u2019re always hit with a tremendous amount of profit-taking, which is why it\u2019s the weakest month of the year. I know that\u2019s somewhat circular reasoning\u2014we sell because we\u2019ve always sold\u2014but it makes more sense than saying people sold tech because they fear a hard landing. Tech, especially big tech, is something you buy, not sell, into weakness if you\u2019re worried about a more severe slowdown.\n\nWhy? Well, because big tech is all about powerful secular themes that can keep going even during a recession\u2014and we\u2019re not getting one. I\u2019m talking about the data center, accelerated computing\u2014they\u2019re not going anywhere. Nevertheless, when anything jars the big tech themes of the moment, the market\u2019s reaction is swift, harsh, and horrible.\u201d\n\nJim Cramer Urges Investors: \u201cDo Not Abandon Ship\u201d\n\nJim Cramer discussed the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday, which will offer new insights into inflation. He noted that if inflation stays steady or falls, the Federal Reserve will have more room to cut interest rates, which could help prevent a recession and address concerns from many sellers. Cramer encouraged investors to remain confident and avoid abandoning their positions due to these uncertainties.\n\n\u201cWednesday, we get another read on inflation\u2014this time from the Consumer Price Index. What can I say? As long as inflation stays the same or goes lower, the Fed has plenty of leeway to cut interest rates and prevent a recession\u2014the thing so many sellers are worried about. That\u2019s why I keep telling you, please do not give up the ship here.\u201d\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.
