        "content": "In the latest market close, Honeywell International Inc. (HON) reached $222.02, with a +1.13% movement compared to the previous day. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.4%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.09%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.63%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the company had gained 7.78% over the past month. This has outpaced the Conglomerates sector's gain of 4.73% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.76% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Honeywell International Inc. in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on October 24, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.51, reflecting a 10.57% increase from the same quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $9.9 billion, up 7.43% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $10.10 per share and a revenue of $38.98 billion, signifying shifts of +10.26% and +6.33%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Honeywell International Inc. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Honeywell International Inc. presently features a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Honeywell International Inc. is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 21.75. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 18.16, so one might conclude that Honeywell International Inc. is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nMeanwhile, HON's PEG ratio is currently 2.52. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Diversified Operations industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.91.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Diversified Operations industry is part of the Conglomerates sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 94, which puts it in the top 38% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Tesla, Lloyds, L'Or\u00e9al, Coca-Cola and Unilever",
        "content": "The third-quarter earnings season is well under way, with companies across a range of sectors due to report in the coming week.\n\nTesla is set to take centre stage next week, as investors await the latest set of results from Elon Musk's EV company, on the back of its recent robotaxi event.\n\nIn the world of finance, the focus so far this earnings season has been on the major US banks, but it is now the turn of UK giants Lloyds, Barclays and NatWest to report in the coming week.\n\nMeanwhile, French cosmetics company L'Or\u00e9al is set to release its third-quarter sales figures.\n\nInvestors will also be looking to see if momentum from Coca-Cola's strong second quarter has carried on into its latest set of results.\n\nConsumer goods company Unilever will also be in focus, as investors keep an eye out for further progress on the business' growth action plan.\n\nHere's more on what to look out for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Wednesday 23 October\n\nShares in Tesla slumped after its recent robotaxi event, in which the electric carmaker revealed its fully autonomous \"Cybercab\", as well as unveiling its \"Robovan\" concept.\n\nA lack of details surrounding the rollout plan and regulatory approval, plus no mention of a more affordable regular EV, left Wall Street wanting more. This most recently volatility in the stock, has left shares down nearly 11% year-to-date.\n\nIn fact, AJ Bell's Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth point out that Tesla is the only one of the \"Magnificent Seven\", which includes tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), to have seen such declines over the past year.\n\nRead more: The best stocks to buy in the UK, according to Barclays\n\n\"Indeed, the shares are down by almost 50% from their 2021 peak, despite ongoing investor enthusiasm for electric vehicles and autonomous driving and \u2014 more specifically to Tesla \u2014 the Cybertruck, Cybercab and the roll out of its supercharger network,\" they said.\n\nThat said, recently released figures showed that Tesla's deliveries were up 6% for the third quarter. AJ Bell's investment experts noted that this \"understandably led analysts to expect better again for the third quarter\" results more broadly.\n\nThey said analysts were expecting sales to come in at $25.5bn (\u00a319.5bn) for the third quarter, which would be 9% higher than a year ago.\n\nAnalysts are also said to be expecting to see further improvement in earnings per share (EPS) of $0.57 in the third-quarter, which would mean a return to year-on-year growth. Tesla's EPS of $0.47 in the second quarter missed expectations and was below the $0.78 it generated for the same period in the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nLloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Wednesday 23 October\n\nThree big UK banks are set to report this week, with Lloyds kicking things off on Wednesday, followed by Barclays (BARC.L) on Thursday and NatWest (NWG.L) on Friday.\n\n\"The banking sector has shown good performance in the past year, despite the shallow recession in the UK in the second half of 2023,\" said AJ Bell's Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth.\n\nAcross those three banks alone, they said that stated pre-tax profit is expected to be generally flat in 2024 and 2025, at around \u00a320bn.\n\nRead more: Interest rate cut in November near certain after inflation drops\n\n\"Thanks to the combination of competition, interest rate cuts from the Bank of England and political and public pressure, net interest margins and net interest income look to have peaked and that is a key reason why analysts think the banks may struggle to grow earnings substantially from here onwards,\" they said.\n\nLooking at Lloyds specifically, the consensus estimate on its headline pre-tax income for the third quarter is \u00a31.6bn, versus \u00a31.9bn for the same period last year.\n\nIn the second quarter, the bank delivered pre-tax profit of \u00a31.7bn, which was higher than the \u00a31.6bn it generated in Q2 2023 and beat market expectations of \u00a31.58bn.\n\nIn terms of dividends, Lloyds is forecast to pay just over 3p a share, which added to its declared \u00a32bn buyback programme, gives a total cash return of \u00a33.9bn for 2024.\n\nYear-to-date Lloyds Banking Group shares are up 29%.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al (OR.PA) \u2014 Reports quarterly sales figures on Tuesday 22 October\n\nThe world's largest cosmetic's company, L'Or\u00e9al is set to report after the market close on Tuesday.\n\nShares have been under pressure this year, down more than 17% year-to-date, with it seeing further declines after the release of half-year results at the end of July.\n\nWhile L'Or\u00e9al reported that like-for-like sales had risen 7.3% to \u20ac22.1bn (\u00a318.4bn) in the first half, the company noted \"depressed beauty demand in China\" amid its economic slowdown.\n\nIn terms of its third quarter, Barclays' equity research team said in a note released on Friday that it was looking for organic sales growth of upwards of 6.2%.\n\nRead more: How to minimise a capital gains tax impact on your investments\n\nBarclays' team said the focus would be on the US consumer in these results and highlighted that growth in its fragrance business \"remains strong and continues to outperform other categories with some share gains for L'Or\u00e9al\".\n\nThe team said they had hoped for a rebound in cosmetics in China in the second half of the year \"but that now seems unlikely given the current weak state of Chinese consumer confidence\".\n\nOverall, they said that L'Or\u00e9al's valuation looks \"undemanding\" relative to where it's stood historically and that \"conversations with investors suggest many are tempted to add or buy at these levels\".\n\n\"We see risks as skewed to the upside, with expectations low and any sense of sequential stabilisation likely well received,\" they added.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Wednesday 23 October\n\nShares in soft drinks company Coca-Cola hit an all-time high closing price last month of $73.01 per share, with the stock up 19% year-to-date.\n\nAarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that the company's second-quarter results in July \"blew the lid off market expectations\".\n\nCoco-Cola reported net revenues were up 3% in the second quarter to $12.4bn, while organic sales grew by 15%.\n\nRead more:What UK wealth managers and investment platforms want to see in the budget\n\nThis led management to upgrade full-year guidance for the second time this year, expecting organic revenue to grow between 9% and 10% in 2024.\n\n\"When the group reports results next week, investors expect to hear that some of this momentum has spilled into the third quarter,\" Chiekrie said. \"But Coca-Cola\u2019s rolling into some tough comparable periods for growth over the second half of the year, so don\u2019t expect the same level of positive surprise as in the first half.\"\n\nHe added: \"Cash generation remains very healthy, providing scope for increased share buybacks and potentially even new acquisitions in the near to medium term.\u201d\n\nUnilever (ULVR.L) \u2014 Reports third-quarter results on Thursday 24 October\n\nConsumer goods giant Unilever has been trading close to five-year highs, point out AJ Bell's investment experts, as investors \"respond favourably to chief executive Hein Schumacher\u2019s growth action plan\".\n\nThe plan, launched in March, will see the group spin off its ice cream business, cut \u20ac800m in costs \u2014 which includes 7,500 redundancies \u2014 and invest heavily in its thirty \"power brands\".\n\nUnliever's group underlying sales are forecast to have risen by 4.2% in the third quarter, up slightly from 3.9% in Q2. Meanwhile, stated revenues are forecast to have risen by 1.5% to \u20ac15.5bn.\n\nAJ Bell's Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth point out that Unilever\u2019s \"long-term target range for sales growth is 3% to 5% a year and current guidance from Mr Schumacher is for underlying sales growth to come within that range in 2024 overall\".\n\nRead more: European Central Bank cuts interest rates for the third time this year\n\nWhile they said that Unliever may not offer too much detail on profits, analysts will look for any comment on its underlying operating margin for the year, which it had said was expected to exceed 18% versus 16.7% last year.\n\n\"Analysts will also look for an update on the planned demerger of the ice cream business, which is due to occur by the end of 2025, especially with regard to whether the company will list its shares in London or Amsterdam,\" they said.\n\nIn addition, AJ Bell's investment experts said that shareholders will be keeping an eye out any further hints of wider merger and acquisition activity, \"given Mr Schumacher\u2019s plan to make selective purchases and also prune the range of brands by means of disposals.\"\n\nOther companies reporting this week include:\n\nMonday 21 October\n\nTristel (TSTL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP.DE)\n\nSandvik (SAND.ST)\n\nTuesday 22 October\n\nVirgin Wine (VINO.L)\n\nInterContinental Hotels (IHG.L)\n\nGear4Music (G4M.L)\n\nChina Mobile (600941.SS)\n\nSK Hynix (000660.KS)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nLogitech (LOGN.SW)\n\nSaab (SAAB-B.ST)\n\nRandstad (RAND.AS)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nPhilip Morris International (PM)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nRTX (RTX)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nKimberly-Clark (KMB)\n\nCoStar Group (CSGP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSeagate (STX)\n\nPackaging Corp (PKG)\n\nInterpublic (IPG)\n\nWednesday 23 October\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nWPP (WPP.L)\n\nBarratt Redrow (BTRW.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nHong Kong Exchanges (0388.HK)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATCO-A.ST)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nHeineken (HEIA.AS)\n\nAssa Abloy (ASSA-B.ST)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZA.AS)\n\nDeutsche Bank (DBK.DE)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nVolvo Cars (VOLV-B.ST)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-B.ST)\n\nSaipem (SPM.MI)\n\nViscofan (VIS.MC)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nAmphenol (APH)\n\nGE Vernova (GEV)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nTeradyne (TER)\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS)\n\neBay (EBAY)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nThursday 24 October\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLondon Stock Exchange (LSEG.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nInchape (INCH.L)\n\nRenishaw (RSW.L)\n\nEssentra (ESNT.L)\n\nDunelm (DNLM.L)\n\nBloomsbury Publishing (BMY.L)\n\nLuceco (LUCE.L)\n\nCanon (7751.T)\n\nRenasas (6723.T)\n\nCNOOC (0883.HK)\n\nHyundai Motor (005380.KS)\n\nBudweiser Brewing Company (1876.HK)\n\nHerm\u00e8s (RMS.PA)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nVinci (DG.PA)\n\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes (DSY.PA)\n\nDanone (BN.PA)\n\nBeiersdorf (BEI.DE)\n\nKone (KNEBV.HE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.ST)\n\nSodexo (SW.PA)\n\nBE Semiconductor (BESI.AS)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nStora Enso (STERV.HE)\n\nUnion Pacific (UNP)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper KDP (KDP)\n\nDow (DOW)\n\nWestern Digital (WDC)\n\nHasbro (HAS)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nUS Steel (X)\n\nFriday 25 October\n\nNatWest (NWG.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nRecord (REC.L)\n\nFanuc (6954.T)\n\nICBC (601398.SS)\n\nPing An Insurance (601318.SS)\n\nGreat Wall Motor (601633.SS)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nSafran (SAF.PA)\n\nPorsche (PAH3.DE)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.DE)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nENI (ENI.MI)\n\nSika.SW (SIKA.SW)\n\nSGS (SGSN.SW)\n\nKonecranes (KCR.HE)\n\nR\u00e9my Cointreau (RCO.PA)\n\nKindred (KIND-SDB.ST)\n\nColgate-Palmolive (CL)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Madison Investments, an investment advisor, released its \u201cMadison Dividend Income Fund\u201d third-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the third quarter, the fund (Class Y) appreciated +10.1% and outperformed the +5.9%, +9.4%, and +8.2% returns for the S&P 500, Russell 1000 Value, and Lipper Equity Income peer group, respectively. YTD, the fund returned +9.5% compared to +22.1%, +16.7%, and +16.2% returns for the indexes. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nMadison Dividend Income Fund highlighted stocks like Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) in the third quarter 2024 investor letter. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is an industrial conglomerate, engages in aerospace technologies, building automation, energy and sustainable solutions, and industrial automation businesses. The one-month return of Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) was 7.97%, and its shares gained 21.08% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 17, 2024, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) stock closed at $219.55 per share with a market capitalization of $143.02 billion.\n\nMadison Dividend Income Fund stated the following regarding Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"This quarter we are highlighting Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) as a relative yield example in the Industrials sector. HON is a premier industrial conglomerate with leading businesses in commercial aerospace, industrial automation, energy sustainability solutions, and building automation. A common theme across these end markets is that HON embeds its products into the operations of its customers, which generates recurring revenue from aftermarket products/services and leads to high customer switching costs. We believe HON has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its wide installed base of equipment, strong reputation, pricing power, high customer switching costs, and technological expertise.\n\nOur thesis on HON is that it appears well positioned for consistent growth, driven by a recovery in commercial aerospace following the Covid pandemic coupled with favorable secular trends in automation, remote security management and energy savings in buildings. The company made a strategic shift in recent years away from lumpy product sales towards connected systems and software, which lowers cyclicality and increases recurring revenues; we estimate that 30% of revenues are recurring in nature. This focus on software and recurring revenues has resulted in strong returns on invested capital (ROIC) over time that have easily exceeded the company\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (WACC), something we expect to continue for years to come\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nStory continues\n\nA bustling industrial facility with a series of chemical filtration systems on display.\n\nHoneywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is not on our list of\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 50 hedge fund portfolios held Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) at the end of the second quarter which was 52 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
