        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy on the Dip Before They Rebound: Summer 2024",
        "content": "Wall Street\u2019s seasoned investors often look for stocks to buy on the dip. This strategy involves purchasing stocks that have experienced a temporary downturn in the hope that they will rebound. So far in 2024, the benchmark S&P 500 index has advanced 11%. Yet, not all stocks have participated in this rally. For example, while many tech stocks have soared, other sectors, such as industrial real estate or healthcare, have underperformed the S&P500. In most cases, disappointing earnings, negative news cycles on the economy or a given industry, or broader sector fluctuations have dampened investors\u2019 spirit.\n\nSimilarly, small-cap shares on Wall Street have not participated in the rally as much either. However, these declines may be temporary, offering a chance to capitalize on undervalued companies with strong rebound potential. With that information, we explore three stocks to buy on the dip that are prime candidates for a summer rebound.\n\nGlobal Payments (GPN) Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nFirst up on our list of stocks to buy on the dip is Global Payments (NYSE:GPN), which provides payment technology and software solutions. The company operates through three primary segments: Merchant Solutions, Issuer Solutions, and Business and Consumer Solutions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Global Payments reported adjusted net revenue of $2.18 billion, marking a 6.6% year-over-year (YoY) increase. Adjusted net income rose 5.6% to $666.5 million. Meanwhile, the adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged by 8% YoY to $2.59. The company attributed this growth to strong execution across its businesses and resilient consumer trends despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe payment solutions company has seen significant growth in its business-to-business (B2B) segment. Significantly, the MineralTree business achieved a 30% increase in new bookings during the first quarter. This figure includes a nearly 60% improvement in new virtual card bookings as adoption continues to accelerate.\n\nSo far in 2024, GPN stock has tumbled more than 20%. As a result, the shares are trading at an attractive value of 8.5 times forward earnings and 2.6 times sales. Meanwhile, analysts have a 12-month price target of $150 for GPN, signaling over a 50% upside.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeauty industry behemoth Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is the next name on our list of stocks to buy on the dip. The company is renowned for its high-quality skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. Its brands include La Mer, Clinique, Tom Ford Beauty, and Jo Malone London.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn early May, Estee Lauder posted strong financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Net sales grew 5% to $3.94 billion compared to the prior-year period. Organic sales rose nearly 6% YOY, driven by double-digit growth in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d) region. Adjusted operating income surged 75% YOY to $554 million. Meanwhile, adjusted constant currency EPS jumped 117% to reach $1.02.\n\nIn late April, Estee Lauder and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced the creation of an AI Innovation Lab. This collaboration leverages the cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) capabilities of Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service. The companies will develop solutions that will create closer consumer connections and increase speed to market with local relevancy.\n\nDespite strong fundamentals, EL stock has dropped almost 15% YTD. The stock is currently trading at 30.12 times forward earnings and 2.9 times sales. Wall Street\u2019s 12-month median price forecast of $142.1 for EL suggests a 15% upside potential from current levels.\n\nHoneywell International (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother strong candidate for stocks to buy on the dip is Honeywell International (NASDAQ:HON), the industrial conglomerate with diversified technology and manufacturing operations. As a blue chip stock, Honeywell offers investors stability and growth potential through its robust portfolio, which spans aerospace, building technologies, performance materials, and safety solutions.\n\nHoneywell reported solid earnings for the first quarter of 2024. The company generated revenues of $9.1 billion, up 3% YoY. Strong growth in the aerospace and building technologies segments contributed to the increase in revenues. Net income from continuing operations reached $1.46 billion, translating to an EPS of $2.23 compared with $2.07 for the year-ago quarter.\n\nHoneywell remains committed to innovation and strategic partnerships to maintain its competitive edge. In mid May, Honeywell joined forces with Enel (OTCMKTS:ENLAY) North America to create a solution that automates building controls in commercial and industrial facilities. This will allow businesses to adjust their energy usage to help stabilize the power grid.\n\nDespite these strong metrics and developments, HON stock is down 3.5% YTD. However, we should remind potential Honeywell investors that the dividend yield is 2.1%. The shares are trading at 20.45 times future earnings and 3.64 times sales. Finally, Wall Street\u2019s 12-month median price forecast for HON stands at $220.00, an upside potential of around 9%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.
