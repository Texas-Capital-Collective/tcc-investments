        "content": "Reflecting a robust increase from last year's projection, Honeywell's (HON, Financials) current global business aviation outlook forecasts delivery of up to 8,500 new business aircraft valued at $280 billion over the next decade. This estimate underscores the growing demands in the aviation space.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SAVE.\n\nThe five-year new jet purchase plans of business aviation operators stayed constant with last year's data, implying that demand for new aircraft is stabilizing at levels significantly above those before the pandemic. The poll also emphasizes manufacturers' intentions to increase output in response to predicted stable book-to-ratios spanning through 2024 and significant backlogs.\n\n\"We do not see any positive trend changing any time soon; the business aviation industry is in a protracted period of healthy growth,\" said Heath Patrick, president of Americas Aftermarket at Honeywell Aerospace Technologies. While spending is expected to rise by 11%, Honeywell forecasts business jet deliveries in 2025 to be 12% higher than in 2024. Furthermore demonstrating the continuous expansion in the industry, more than 90% of Honeywell's survey participants expect flying either more or the same in 2025 compared to 2024.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Honeywell International Inc. HON is scheduled to release third-quarter 2024 results on Oct. 24, before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.9 billion, indicating growth of 7.4% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $2.51 per share, which has edged down 0.4% in the past 60 days. The figure indicates a jump of 10.6% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. The company\u2019s earnings beat the consensus estimate in the preceding four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 2.1%. In the last reported quarter, its bottom line beat the consensus estimate by 2.9%. Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\r\n\r\nLet us see how things have shaped up for Honeywell this earnings season.\n\nKey Factors & Estimates for Q3\n\nStrength across Honeywell\u2019s commercial aviation aftermarket business, driven by strong demand in the air transport and business aviation markets, is likely to have supplemented the top-line performance of its Aerospace Technologies segment. Also, strength in the company\u2019s commercial aviation original equipment business, backed by an improvement in build rates, is likely to have augmented the segment\u2019s performance. Solid momentum in the defense and space business, owing to stable U.S. and international defense spending volumes, is expected to have been a tailwind as well. We expect the segment\u2019s revenues to increase 12.8% year over year to $3.95 billion in the third quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment is expected to witness a year-over-year increase in revenues, driven by higher orders for its products and solutions within the advanced materials business. However, softness in gas processing equipment projects under the UOP business is likely to have dragged its performance. Our estimate for the segment\u2019s revenues is pegged at $1.57 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 1.4%.\r\n\r\nSolid demand for building products and solutions, along with the acquisition of Global Access Solutions (in June 2024), is expected to have driven the Building Automation segment\u2019s performance. \r\n\r\nHowever, Honeywell\u2019s Industrial Automation segment\u2019s performance is expected to have been weak in the quarter. Persistent weakness in the company\u2019s warehouse and workflow solutions and sensing and safety technologies businesses owing to lower demand for projects is expected to have hurt the segment's top-line performance. Also, continued softness in the warehouse automation business owing to lower investments in the market is likely to weigh on its results. For the third quarter, our estimate for revenues from the Building Technologies and Industrial Automation segments is pegged at $1.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe escalating cost of sales is likely to have posed a threat to HON\u2019s bottom line. Acquisition-related costs and high input costs are expected to have pushed up its operating expenses, which are likely to have reflected in its margins. We expect the costs of sales to be $6.2 billion for the third quarter, indicating an increase of 9.1% year over year.\r\n\r\nHON has considerable exposure to overseas markets. Given the company\u2019s substantial international operations, foreign currency headwinds are likely to have marred its margins and profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nHoneywell International Inc.

        "content": "33rd annual Global Business Aviation Outlook projects 8,500 new business jet deliveries valued at $280 billion over the next decade Purchase plans indicate that demand for new aircraft is normalizing at an elevated level, significantly above pre-pandemic figures Aircraft utilization is projected to increase with vast majority of operators planning on flying more or the same as they did this year\n\nLAS VEGAS, Oct. 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today published its 33rd annual Global Business Aviation Outlook, which provides unique insights into current industry trends as well as longer-cycle developments and is informed by extensive surveys of business aviation operators across the globe. Honeywell Logo. (PRNewsFoto/Honeywell) (PRNewsfoto/Honeywell)\n\nBased on survey results, Honeywell forecasts up to 8,500 new business jets worth $280 billion will be delivered over the next decade, an increase in value from last year's forecast. However, the five-year new jet purchase plans of business aviation operators surveyed remained on par with last year's results, indicating that demand for new aircraft is stabilizing well above pre-pandemic levels. In addition, the survey reveals ongoing plans by business jet manufacturers to ramp up production in response to strong backlogs and stable book-to-bill ratios persisting through 2024.\n\n\"The business aviation industry is in a prolonged period of healthy growth, and we don't see that positive trend changing any time soon,\" said Heath Patrick, president, Americas Aftermarket, Honeywell Aerospace Technologies. \"Business aviation continues to see more users and, as a result, manufacturers are ramping up production to keep pace with growing demand, a trend we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. Despite a mixed macroeconomic environment and challenging geopolitical circumstances, operators are optimistic about their flight activity increasing in 2025 and beyond.\"\n\nKey findings in the 2024 Honeywell Global Business Aviation Outlook include:\n\nNew business jet deliveries in 2025 are expected to be 12% higher than in 2024. Expenditures are expected to be 11% higher. Five-year purchase plans for new business jets are comparable with last year's survey and equivalent to 18% of the current fleet. Fleet additions are consistent with results from a year ago at 3% of the fleet, which is in line with historical industry performance. More than 90% of those surveyed expect to fly more or about the same in 2025 than in 2024. Large jets are expected to account for about two-thirds of all expenditures of new business jets in the next five years, consistent with last year's results. 82% of respondents consider \"Performance\" among their top three most important criteria when purchasing their next aircraft. \"Cost\" was second at 60%.\n\nStory continues\n\nNew Business Aviation User Update: Returning to a Stable Growth Environment\n\nFollowing an influx of first-time business aviation users into the industry throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with record levels of flight activity, the industry has begun to return to a more stable growth environment at new elevated levels of production and flight activity. Demand remains robust for new aircraft as business jet manufacturer backlogs stay strong and production volumes ramp up to accommodate that higher demand.\n\nBased on the findings of this year's survey, several key industry trends to watch include:\n\nDemand for New Aircraft: New aircraft models introduced in recent years have driven increased demand for new aircraft, a trend which survey results indicate will continue throughout this decade and into the early 2030s. Flight Activity & Utilization Levels: Flight activity is expected to increase in 2025 relative to 2024, especially for those who currently operate at high utilization levels. The reduction in barriers to access business aviation in recent years, driven by the introduction of new shared access models, has enabled a persistent flow of new customers opting for business aviation alternatives for their travel needs. Fractional Operators: Fractional operators may be the largest beneficiaries of new customer growth, and they are also benefitting from traditional operators wanting to supplement their current operations with fractional shares. The business aviation industry has experienced changing dynamics in recent years, resulting in new higher levels of aircraft deliveries and flight activity than seen in the previous decade, and the sector appears poised to achieve stable growth on top of this over the next decade.\n\nRegional Breakdown: North America Sees Strongest Demand, But Latin America Shows Optimism\n\nNorth America: North America will see 66% of the five-year new jet deliveries, which is consistent with historical demand for the region. 30% of respondents from North America expect to fly more next year, amounting to a large proportion of the demand, which is likely contributing to the sustained growth of new jet deliveries.\n\nEurope: European operators will comprise 13% of the five-year new jet deliveries, which is one percentage point below last year's share and follows a similar trend over the past few years. A strong regional focus on sustainability, environmental pressures, and the availability of alternative transit options are the likely cause of this slight dip in new aircraft demand.\n\nLatin America: Operators in Latin America will account for 10% of the five-year new jet deliveries, which is an increase of five percentage points from their share in 2023. In contrast to last year, respondents in Latin America are optimistic about favorable macroeconomic conditions, which will likely drive increased flight activity as well as demand for new jets. This effect is particularly strong in Brazil where year-over-year flight activity growth is stronger than the global average.\n\nAsia Pacific: Operators in Asia Pacific will make up 7% of the five-year new jet deliveries. APAC is returning to typical fleet growth after several years of decline throughout the pandemic. There is a notable uptick in flight activity in Australia, where departures are up nearly double digits year-over-year.\n\nMiddle East/Africa: Fleet growth here accounts for 3% of the five-year new jet deliveries, which is a decline of three percentage points from last year's surveyed expectations. Flight activity in the region declined year-over-year through the first half of 2024, likely due to conflicts in the region.\n\nPreowned Aircraft Update: Market Cools From Record-Low Inventory Levels\n\nThe market for pre-owned aircraft is cooling after record low inventory levels in 2021 and 2022, but used aircraft values remain strong relative to the previous decade. While pre-owned aircraft inventory will likely continue to increase slowly, prices should remain stable, thereby supporting steady demand for pre-owned aircraft. Operators mentioned expecting to rely on pre-owned aircraft purchases to expand their fleets slightly more than in prior years.\n\nSustainability in Business Aviation: Fuel-Efficient Aircraft Recognized as Most Effective Method of Improving Environmental Impact\n\nIn light of Honeywell's commitment to driving aviation sustainability and reaching carbon neutrality by 2035 in its operations and facilities, this year's survey \u2013 for the fourth consecutive year \u2013 features an analysis of sustainability in business aviation and also examines how operators are trying to lower their carbon footprint. Several key findings include:\n\nEuropean operators show the most proactive behavior in lowering their carbon footprint, with North American operators lagging slightly behind. However, the total number of operators taking proactive steps in North America is still greater than any other region given the much larger volume of business aviation operations in the region. According to those surveyed, the acquisition of new, more fuel-efficient aircraft is considered to be the most effective method to reduce environmental impact, with 85% of respondents mentioning this to be 'very effective' or 'moderately effective.'\n\nClick here to request a copy of Honeywell's 2024 Global Business Aviation Outlook.\n\nMethodology\n\nHoneywell's forecast methodology is based on multiple sources, including macroeconomic analyses, original equipment manufacturers' production and development plans shared with the company, and expert deliberations from aerospace industry leaders. Honeywell, in partnership with Seefeld Marketing International Inc. and Ad Hoc Recherche Inc., also conducted surveys of business aviation operators comprising 375 nonfractional operators representing a fleet of 1,488 business aircraft worldwide. The survey sample is representative of the entire industry in terms of geography, operation and fleet composition. This comprehensive approach provides Honeywell with unique insights into operator sentiments, preferences and concerns and provides considerable intelligence on product development needs and opportunities.\n\nMaking an Impact on Business Decisions\n\nHoneywell's Global Business Aviation Outlook reflects current operator concerns and identifies longer-cycle trends that Honeywell uses in its own product decision process. The survey has helped to identify opportunities for investments in sustainability solutions, enhance aircraft connectivity offerings, and expand propulsion offerings, innovative safety products, services and upgrades. The survey informs Honeywell's business pursuit strategy and helps consistently position the company on high-value platforms in growth sectors.\n\nAbout Honeywell\n\nProducts and services from Honeywell Aerospace Technologies\u00a0are found on virtually every commercial, defense and space aircraft, and in many terrestrial systems.
