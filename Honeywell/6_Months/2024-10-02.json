        "title": "Will Honeywell International (HON) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Honeywell International Inc. (HON), which belongs to the Zacks Diversified Operations industry.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 3.05%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Honeywell International came out with earnings of $2.49 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.42 per share, representing a surprise of 2.89%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.18 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.25 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.21%.\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Honeywell International. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nHoneywell International currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.04%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 24, 2024.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "These 3 Bargain-Bin Dividend Value Stocks Have Become Too Cheap to Ignore",
        "content": "The major stock market indexes continue to blast through record highs as 2024 shapes up to be another great year for investors. Since the start of 2023, the S&P 500 is up a mind-numbing 49.5%.\n\nDespite the impressive performance, investors can still scoop up shares of quality companies without paying an exorbitant price relative to earnings. Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON), Phillips 66(NYSE: PSX), and Delta Air Lines(NYSE: DAL) are three value stocks that pay dividends and are worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHoneywell is making an effort to please investors with capital commitments\n\nDaniel Foelber (Honeywell): On Sept. 27, Honeywell increased its dividend by 4.6% from $4.32 per share per year to $4.52. The increase puts Honeywell on track to deliver its 15th consecutive year of higher dividends in 2025 and is part of the company's plan to boost shareholder value through dividends, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and buybacks.\n\nHoneywell's growth has been disappointing in recent years as the company has failed to convert opportunities in automation, the industrial Internet of Things, aerospace, and the energy transition into meaningful top- and bottom-line results. But there's reason to be optimistic going forward.\n\nHoneywell tends to be a stodgy company that is slow to change. But in June 2023, former head of Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies, Vimal Kapur, took over as Honeywell CEO. In October 2023, Honeywell announced a strategic shift to realign its business to capitalize on its highest-conviction megatrends.\n\nIn its July investor presentation, Honeywell said it had already announced $10 billion in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) since 2023 and was on track to reduce its share count by 2% in 2024 through buybacks. The company is targeting $22 billion in share repurchases, M&A, and dividends between 2023 and 2025.\n\nHoneywell remains in prove-it mode, but it has done a good job resetting expectations and setting a clear path toward achieving the steady earnings growth that investors were used to in years past.\n\nAs for Honeywell's valuation, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow ratio are both below their five-year median levels, suggesting investors are less optimistic about the company's future prospects. HON Price to Free Cash Flow (5y Median) Chart\n\nHoneywell was a market darling in the 2010s, posting a total return of 499% compared to 257% for the S&P 500. But in the 2020s, Honeywell has been a market underperformer for good reason, considering its underwhelming earnings growth.\n\nIt's too early to say the worst is over for Honeywell, but the stock's valuation, growing dividend, and potential to accelerate its turnaround make it a worthy value stock to consider buying now.\n\nStory continues\n\nForget the brakes, it's time to step on the gas with Phillips 66 stock\n\nScott Levine (Phillips 66): You don't have to be an expert in energy stocks to know that when oil and gas prices decline, energy stocks are likely to also slide. This is certainly the case with Phillips 66 over the past six months. During this time period, oil-price benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell about 12.3%, and shares of Phillips 66 have plunged more than 17%. For forward-looking investors, this sell-off provides a great buying opportunity for the energy stock -- along with its juicy 3.5% forward-yielding dividend.\n\nAn operator of various midstream and downstream assets, Phillips 66 has reported strong financial results so far in 2024 albeit not as high as in the same period during 2023. Through the first half of 2024, Phillips 66 reported $3.3 billion in operating cash flow, a decrease from the $4.5 billion in cash from operations that it reported during the same period in 2023.\n\nIt's critical to recognize, however, that the inferior performance simply reflects the impact of falling commodity prices. In fact, Phillips 66 achieved $100 million in cost reductions in the first and second quarters of 2024, and in its refining segment, the company reported 98% crude utilization -- the highest such rate in over five years.\n\nAlthough the stock's slide may be disconcerting for some, it by no means signals that investors should keep it off their buy lists. Energy prices will rise again, and Phillips 66 stock will likely rebound with them. Until then -- and even after -- investors can rake in a steady stream of passive income as management intends to return 50% of operating cash flow to investors in the form of dividends.\n\nAn excellent value stock in the transportation sector\n\nLee Samaha(Delta Air Lines): The airline trades at just 7.7 times its estimated 2024 earnings and represents an excellent value opportunity for investors looking for exposure to airline stocks. The low valuation is likely a reflection of the perceived risk in the stock coming from its debt profile and its exposure to the cyclical nature of the airline industry.\n\nHowever, those risks look overstated. Delta Air Lines currently has $19.2 billion in net debt, but management is focused on paying it down -- and with $3 billion to $4 billion in free cash flow expected in 2024, it will have resources to do so further this year.\n\nIn addition, investors recently received some good news on the \"cyclicality\" issue. In usual cycles, airlines have tended to build capacity as the market improves, only to overextend themselves and walk into a period of overcapacity when demand growth starts to slow. The result is usually a sharp profit slowdown, as airlines stubbornly maintain unprofitable routes while waiting for an upturn.\n\nInvestors were worried about that scenario when overcapacity reared its head in the summer. However, Delta and United Airlines' management spoke at a conference recently and confirmed that the industry had acted rationally and cut less-profitable routes. As such, Delta and United are improving their revenue per available seat miles (RASM) metric again, implying that the overcapacity issue has gone.\n\nThat's good news. With interest rates set to move lower, airlines could benefit from improved consumer discretionary spending and corporate travel. As such, Delta Air Lines looks like an excellent value stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Honeywell International right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Honeywell International, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Honeywell International wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 October 2, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Honeywell International Inc. HON, Accenture plc ACN, City Holding Co. CHCO and First United Corp. FUNC.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTime to Buy These 4 Stocks with Rising Dividend Yields\n\nWall Street is back in rally and ended September on a high after a rough start to what is historically considered the worst month for stocks. The Federal Reserve\u2019s jumbo rate cut has also fueled the stock market rally.\n\nHowever, concerns remain about the economy's health, which saw consumer confidence decline in September. Given this situation, cautious investors looking for a steady income and preservation of their capital may want to continue holding or buying dividend-paying stocks. Four such stocks are Honeywell International Inc., Accenture plc, City Holding Co. and First United Corp.\n\nWall Steet Rallies After Rate Cuts\n\nWall Street had a choppy start to September after fears were reignited that the economy was slowing and the Federal Reserve may have delayed too long to start its easing cycle. However, stocks rebounded after fresh economic data showed that inflation declined further in August.\n\nAlso, the Federal Reserve finally announced a half-percentage point rate cut in its September policy meeting. Stocks have since been on a rally. On Monday, the rally was fueled by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said that more rate cuts could be coming. On Monday, the S&P 500 closed at a new record high of 5,762.48 points.\n\nSeptember has historically been the worst month for Wall Street but stock markets defied the norm this year. The S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq closed higher by 2%, 1.9% and 2.7%, respectively, for the month.\n\nSinking Consumer Confidence Could Make Stock Markets Volatile\n\nAlthough stocks have been performing well, concerns remain about the economy\u2019s health. Market participants were expecting a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Fed in September. Many have been viewing the Fed\u2019s decision to cut rates by 50 basis points as an aggressive step to help the economy make a soft landing.\n\nConcerns over a slowing economy saw consumer confidence drop to 98.7 in September from an upwardly revised 105.6 in August to its lowest level in three years.\n\nGiven this situation, it would thus be ideal to invest in dividend stocks. These companies, with their solid operations, consistently deliver dividends and stay profitable thanks to their dependable business models. In a market with high volatility, companies that provide substantial dividend payouts often perform better than those that do not offer dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nDividend Paying Stocks Are a Safe Bet\n\nHoneywell International Inc.\n\nHoneywell International Inc. is a global diversified technology and manufacturing company, with a wide range of products and services.
