        "title": "Honeywell Grabs $103M Deal From U.S. Army for Radar Altimeter System",
        "content": "Honeywell International Inc. HON recently secured a contract worth $103 million from the U.S. Army to offer its next-generation APN-209 radar altimeter (Next Gen APN-209) system for various army aircraft. The latest deal is built on a long-standing partnership where HON has served as a reliable altimeter provider to the U.S. Department of Defense, with more than 150,000 units supplied.\r\n\r\nHON\u2019s shares inched up 0.8% yesterday, eventually closing the session at $217.60.\n\nInside the Headlines\n\nHoneywell's Next Gen APN-209 is the modified version of its APN-209 system, which has served as the primary radar altimeter on several U.S. military aircraft since 1975. The advanced technology embedded in the updated radar altimeter system boosts the safety, reliability and operational capability of army aircraft, particularly in adverse weather conditions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Next Gen APN-209 features HON\u2019s common-core radar altimeter architecture similar to its civil radar altimeters that minimize risks related to component obsolescence and supply-chain disruptions. It also boasts flexible integration options that come either with an integrated altitude indicator or as a separate transceiver, thereby catering to several aircraft requirements.\n\nHON\u2019s Zacks Rank & Price Performance\n\nHoneywell, with approximately $141.4 billion market capitalization, currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The company is grappling with persistent softness in its Industrial Automation segment. Weakness in the warehouse and workflow solutions businesses due to lower demand for projects has been affecting the segment's performance.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHigh debt level also remains a concern. Exiting second-quarter 2024, the company\u2019s long-term debt was $20.9 billion, higher than $16.6 billion at 2023-end. The increase in its debt level was primarily attributable to the funds raised for the Global Access Solutions acquisition. Considering its high debt level, its cash and cash equivalents of $9.6 billion do not look impressive. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the past three months, the company\u2019s shares have lost 0.4% against the industry\u2019s 2.7% growth.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $10.10 per share for 2024, indicating a decrease of 0.5% from the 60-day-ago figure.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked companies from the same space are discussed below.\r\n\r\nMarkel Group Inc.
