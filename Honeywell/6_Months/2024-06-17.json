        "content": "Automation stocks can be a tricky subject fundamentally speaking. With advances in artificial intelligence combined with enhanced connectivity \u2013 as in the Internet of Things or IoT \u2013 machines can end up taking over human jobs. It\u2019s not an insignificant dilemma. I mean, historically, the underlying disparity sparked a massive ideological divide between socialism and free-market capitalism.\n\nHowever, the concept underlying automation stocks doesn\u2019t have to be all doom and gloom. Rather, by accepting that technology constantly moves forward, we can embrace this new era of innovation. Yes, certain sectors and jobs face disruption risks, there\u2019s no doubt about it. Nevertheless, over time, smart machines and algorithms should help accelerate productivity.\n\nFor investors, the situation is far more straightforward. Ultimately, you care about the bottom line. With the tech ecosystem crafting new methodologies and protocols, a renaissance of productivity awaits us. Your job is to get in before the wave hits. With that, let\u2019s go the hands-free approach with automation stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHoneywell (HON) Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background.

Tech Stocks to buy\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoneywell (NASDAQ:HON) represents an industrial conglomerate, specializing in myriad applied-science specialties. But regarding automation stocks, it arguably plays the biggest role in the industrial automation subsector. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global arena can expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% to 2029. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s important.\n\nCovering experts believe that in fiscal 2024, Honeywell may reach $38.66 billion on the top line, translating to year-over-year growth of 5.5%. In fiscal 2025, sales could hit $41.05 billion, implying 6.2% growth. Granted, the CAGR here is conspicuously below that of the expected expansion rate of the industrial automation category.\n\nNevertheless, HON stock again represents an investment into a conglomerate. It covers myriad sectors, which means it\u2019s not going to be a pure-play idea on automation stocks. However, this wide breadth also gives you an advantage in the form of a predictable business. Predictable businesses typically pay dividends.\n\nIn this case, Honeywell offers a forward yield of 2.07% with a sustainably low payout ratio of 48.9%. It\u2019s not exciting but don\u2019t overlook it.\n\nRockwell Automation (ROK) Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nRockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) falls more in line with a direct play on industrial automation stocks. Admittedly, the company represents a higher-risk profile than Honeywell. Currently, analysts peg ROK stock as a consensus hold. Further, the average price target comes in at only $276.67, implying 9% upside. That said, the most optimistic target calls for $316 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nPart of the hesitation in Rockwell centers on poor projections for its fiscal 2024 top line. Sales might land at only $8.6 billion, which would be 5.1% down from the prior year. However, it should be noted that the high-side revenue target calls for $9.33 billion. What\u2019s more, Rockwell\u2019s first quarter of 2024 earnings was strong: an earnings surprise of 15.7% while beating the consensus sales forecast.\n\nThat tells me that Rockwell may be due for a stronger-than-expected year in fiscal 2024. Further, analysts either way expect a recovery in fiscal 2025, with sales rising to $9.08 billion. Here, the blue-sky target calls for $9.79 billion.\n\nRight now, ROK stock trades for 3.27X trailing-year revenue. That\u2019s much lower than the 4.57X multiple that we saw a year ago.\n\nStryker (SYK) The Stryker (SYK) office in Fremont, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStryker (NYSE:SYK) offers significant relevancies for the healthcare segment of automation stocks. According to Grand View Research, the medical automation market reached a valuation of $44.44 billion in 2022. Between 2023 to 2030, the sector could expand at a CAGR of 9.04%. At the forecast culmination point, the industry could be worth $88.11 billion.\n\nWhen it comes to projections, Stryker is right there. For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate that earnings per share will hit $11.96, up 12.8% from the prior year\u2019s print of $10.60. On the top line, sales may reach $22.31 billion, That would be up 8.8%. Further, the high-side target calls for sales of $22.43 billion, up 9.41%. Again, it\u2019s riding the expectation for the market.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that even the most optimistic analysts could be undercutting the expected potential of Stryker. Between Q2 2023 and Q1 2024, the company posted an average EPS of $2.74. This performance translated to an earnings surprise of 5.03%. While not exciting per say, the enterprise is consistently beating expectations.\n\nWhile you\u2019re holding SYK, you\u2019re also getting a forward yield of just under 1%. It\u2019s one of the automation stocks to consider.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) An image of a white, grey, and orange sign with the \"Intuitive Surgical\" logo and number \"1020\" on a patch of grass in front of a white, grey, and orange building on a sunny day.\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is one of the strongest and most popular ideas among medial automation stocks. The chart tells the story, with ISRG stock gaining almost 29% of equity value since the January opener. Of course, whenever you\u2019re dealing with enterprises that are swinging higher, some concerns exist about holding the bag.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing \u2013 do you trust the analysts? At the moment, they\u2019re rating ISRG a consensus strong buy. The average price target of $432.73 isn\u2019t good at all but the high side of $500 gets one thinking. But the most important point for me is the forward projection. In fiscal 2024, experts believe that Intuitive can generate $8.02 billion on the top line. That\u2019s a 12.6% growth rate from last year.\n\nLet\u2019s move onto fiscal 2025. Here, the experts are calling for sales of $9.29 billion. That would be up almost 16% from projected 2024 sales. Of course, the issue with ISRG is that it runs a hot revenue multiple of 20.86X.\n\nBut when you\u2019re handily beating the sector? I think it\u2019s one of the automation stocks to consider.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTechnology juggernaut Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a jack of all trades and a master of most of them. However, for the purposes of discussing automation stocks, it offers significant relevance for the mobility sector. Of course, I\u2019m referring to Waymo but it\u2019s more than just that. With the company being a data-mining powerhouse, it can go far in the self-driving space.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the autonomous vehicle market size may expand from $1.92 trillion in 2023 to $13.63 trillion by 2030. If so, that would represent a CAGR of 32.3%. Now, you\u2019re probably not going to see a growth rate like that from Alphabet at this stage of the game. Still, let\u2019s look at some numbers.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, experts believe that Alphabet will post EPS of $7.57, up 30.5% from the prior year. That\u2019s massive. On the top line, revenue could clock in at $346.6 billion, up 12.8% from 2023\u2019s tally of $307.39 billion. That\u2019s impressive given that Alphabet is much more mature.\n\nGOOGL stock trades at a hot premium of 7.03X trailing-year revenue. Still, it\u2019s well worth it given the expansion of the top and bottom lines.\n\nMobileye (MBLY) Person holding cellphone with website of Israeli autonomous driving company Mobileye (MBLY) on screen in front of logo.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those that want to take a higher-risk wager on mobility-related automation stocks, Mobileye (NASDAQ:MBLY) offers a compelling take. According to MarketsandMarkets, the burgeoning Mobility as a Service sector could reach a valuation of $40.1 billion by 2030. If so, that would imply a CAGR of 32.2%. I mention this because even the mobility subsectors are signaling CAGRs of 30%-plus.\n\nDown the line, this could be a huge opportunity for stakeholders of MBLY stock. Let\u2019s get the bad news out of the way first. Shares have been volatile this year, down nearly 32% year-to-date. Some of the bearish sentiment may be tied to fiscal 2024 sales projections. The consensus target calls for a print of $1.89 billion. That implies a 9.1% decrease from the prior year \u2013 not good.\n\nOkay, here\u2019s the good news. By the end of fiscal 2025, sales could soar to $2.62 billion. That would imply a 38.6% growth rate (admittedly from the lowered expectation of fiscal 2024). Further, the blue-sky target calls for $2.76 billion.\n\nIn terms of risk reward, MBLY stock trades at 12.23X trailing-year sales. That\u2019s well below the year-ago quarter\u2019s print of 15.94X. It\u2019s something to think about.\n\niRobot (IRBT) iRobot (IRBT) Roomba vacuum cleaner robots powerful cleaning system with intelligent sensors to clean Pet hair, crumbs, dirt, and daily dust\n\nSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerhaps the riskiest idea on this list of automation stocks to buy, iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) falls under the consumer tech segment of the hands-free ecosystem. What\u2019s more, the sector appears to be enticing. According to Grand View Research, the global robotic vacuum cleaner market size reached a valuation of $4.48 billion in 2021. Between 2022 to 2030, the sector could expand at a CAGR of 23.4%, resulting in industry sales of $29.82 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. However, the not-so-pleasant side of the coin is iRobot\u2019s projected sales for fiscal 2024. Covering experts anticipate that the top line will slip to $836.64 million, down 6.1% from last year\u2019s haul of $890.58 million. Sure, the most optimistic target calls for $839.82 million but that\u2019s not much better. Not only that, fiscal 2025 sales is only projected to hit $848.31 million. So, the trend isn\u2019t great.\n\nUnsurprisingly, analysts are pensive about IRBT, rating shares a consensus hold. However, the most recent price target calls for $14, which implies 52% upside potential. It\u2019s not impossible for iRobot to get there, considering the brand awareness and the projected growth of the sector.\n\nStill, I\u2019d save IRBT as a speculation only type of play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ:HON) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"After nearly 14 years of owning shares in Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), we decided to sell our investment during the quarter. This decision was based on a combination of issues that threatened our investment thesis for the company. The main challenges were related to organic growth and capital deployment. Specifically, we have concerns about Honeywell's future organic growth and its indecisive approach to capital deployment. Even with a strong balance sheet, cash surplus, and low leverage, its capital deployment process lacks direction. Additionally, Honeywell is heavily invested in cyclical and short-cycle businesses which can be volatile. For these reasons, we sold our investment in Honeywell.\" aero vehicle\n\nCopyright: chalabala / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nHoneywell International Inc.
