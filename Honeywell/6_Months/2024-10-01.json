        "title": "Time to Buy These 4 Stocks With Risking Dividend Yields?",
        "content": "Wall Street is back in rally and ended September on a high after a rough start to what is historically considered the worst month for stocks. The Federal Reserve\u2019s jumbo rate cut has also fueled the stock market rally.\n\nHowever, concerns remain about the economy's health, which saw consumer confidence decline in September. Given this situation, cautious investors looking for a steady income and preservation of their capital may want to continue holding or buying dividend-paying stocks. Four such stocks are Honeywell International Inc. HON, Accenture plc ACN, City Holding Company CHCO and First United Corporation FUNC.\n\nWall Steet Rallies After Rate Cuts\n\nWall Street had a choppy start to September after fears were reignited that the economy was slowing and the Federal Reserve may have delayed too long to start its easing cycle. However, stocks rebounded after fresh economic data showed that inflation declined further in August.\n\nAlso, the Federal Reserve finally announced a half-percentage point rate cut in its September policy meeting. Stocks have since been on a rally. On Monday, the rally was fueled by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said that more rate cuts could be coming. On Monday, the S&P 500 closed at a new record high of 5,762.48 points.\n\nSeptember has historically been the worst month for Wall Street but stock markets defied the norm this year. The S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq closed higher by 2%, 1.9% and 2.7%, respectively, for the month.\n\nSinking Consumer Confidence Could Make Stock Markets Volatile\n\nAlthough stocks have been performing well, concerns remain about the economy\u2019s health. Market participants were expecting a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Fed in September. Many have been viewing the Fed\u2019s decision to cut rates by 50 basis points as an aggressive step to help the economy make a soft landing.\n\nConcerns over a slowing economy saw consumer confidence drop to 98.7 in September from an upwardly revised 105.6 in August to its lowest level in three years.\n\nGiven this situation, it would thus be ideal to invest in dividend stocks. These companies, with their solid operations, consistently deliver dividends and stay profitable thanks to their dependable business models. In a market with high volatility, companies that provide substantial dividend payouts often perform better than those that do not offer dividends.\n\nDividend Paying Stocks Are a Safe Bet\n\nHoneywell International Inc.\n\nHoneywell International Inc. is a global diversified technology and manufacturing company, with a wide range of products and services. HON's diversified portfolio of solutions serves customers globally with aerospace products and services, energy-efficient products and solutions for businesses, and process technology, specialty chemicals, electronic and advanced materials for refining and petrochemicals.

        "content": "Honeywell International Inc. HON has completed the acquisition of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\u2019s APD liquefied natural gas (LNG) process technology and equipment business for $1.81 billion in cash. This marks Honeywell\u2019s fourth acquisition so far this year.\r\n\r\nHON\u2019s shares lost 0.44% yesterday to eventually close the trading session at $206.71.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Pennsylvania, Air Products produces atmospheric, process and specialty gases for various industries, such as refining, chemicals and healthcare. Its LNG technology and equipment division is located in Allentown, PA. This division currently employs around 475 people.\n\nAcquisition Rationale of Honeywell\n\nThe recent acquisition aligns with Honeywell\u2019s strategy of acquiring businesses to enhance its operations and expand its market presence. The inclusion of LNG process technology and equipment business expertise in in-house design and manufacturing of coil-wound heat exchangers and related equipment portfolio will boost its energy transition portfolio. This buyout will allow Honeywell to provide a more comprehensive solution for its customers\u2019 energy transformation requirements.\r\n\r\nHoneywell\u2019s energy transition solution will feature natural gas pre-treatment and advanced liquefaction, utilizing cutting-edge digital automation technologies from the Honeywell Forge and Experion platforms. This integrated solution will help customers manage their natural gas assets more easily and efficiently.\n\nOther Notable Buyouts of Honeywell\n\nHoneywell has been strengthening its business through acquisitions. In September 2024, HON acquired CAES Systems Holdings LLC (\u201cCAES\u201d) from private equity firm Advent. The transaction will augment its defense technology offerings across various domains, including land, sea, air and space.\r\n\r\nIn June 2024, the company acquired Carrier\u2019s Global Access Solutions business for an all-cash deal of $4.95 billion. The inclusion of Global Access Solutions\u2019 expertise in advanced access and security solutions, coupled with its impressive growth and margin profile, will enable Honeywell to expand its security products portfolio and boost its building automation segment. In March 2024, HON announced its plan to purchase Civitanavi Systems S.p.A. for about \u20ac200 million ($217 million) to boost its portfolio of aerospace navigation solutions.\n\nHON\u2019s Zacks Rank\n\nStrength in the commercial aviation and building automation businesses augurs well for Honeywell. The Aerospace segment is particularly strong, driven by robust demand in the aviation aftermarket.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s shares have gained 13.2% compared with the industry\u2019s 21.3% growth.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, weakness in the Industrial Automation segment due to lower demand for projects is worrisome. The weakened demand for personal protective equipment within the sensing and safety technologies business is also concerning.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked companies are discussed below.\r\n\r\nCarlisle Companies Incorporated CSL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nCSL delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 16.3%. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Carlisle\u2019s 2024 earnings has increased 1.7%.\r\n\r\nCrane Company CR presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 11.2%.\r\n\r\nIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CR\u2019s 2024 earnings has increased 2%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Unpacking Q2 Earnings: Otis (NYSE:OTIS) In The Context Of Other General Industrial Machinery Stocks\n\nThe end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let\u2019s take a look at how general industrial machinery stocks fared in Q2, starting with Otis (NYSE:OTIS).\n\nAutomation that increases efficiency and connected equipment that collects analyzable data have been trending, creating new demand for general industrial machinery companies. Those who innovate and create digitized solutions can spur sales and speed up replacement cycles, but all general industrial machinery companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies\u2019 offerings.\n\nThe 14 general industrial machinery stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 4% below.\n\nAfter much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank\u2019s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\nGeneral industrial machinery stocks have held steady amidst all this with average share prices relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.\n\nOtis (NYSE:OTIS)\n\nCredited with inventing the first hydraulic passenger elevator, Otis Worldwide (NYSE:OTIS) is an elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company.\n\nOtis reported revenues of $3.60 billion, down 3.2% year on year. This print fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 3.4%. Overall, it was a softer quarter for the company with a miss of analysts\u2019 organic revenue estimates and full-year revenue guidance missing analysts\u2019 expectations. Otis Total Revenue\n\nInterestingly, the stock is up 5.6% since reporting and currently trades at $104.\n\nRead our full report on Otis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nBest Q2: 3M (NYSE:MMM)\n\nProducers of the first asthma inhaler, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is a global conglomerate known for products in industries like healthcare, safety, electronics, and consumer goods.\n\nStory continues\n\n3M reported revenues of $6.02 billion, down 24.7% year on year, outperforming analysts\u2019 expectations by 3.3%. The business had an exceptional quarter with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 operating margin estimates and a solid beat of analysts\u2019 organic revenue estimates. 3M Total Revenue\n\nThe market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 32.7% since reporting. It currently trades at $137.18.\n\nIs now the time to buy 3M? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWeakest Q2: Hillenbrand (NYSE:HI)\n\nHillenbrand, Inc. (NYSE: HI) is an industrial company that designs, manufactures, and sells highly engineered processing equipment and solutions for various industries.\n\nHillenbrand reported revenues of $786.6 million, up 9.8% year on year, falling short of analysts\u2019 expectations by 3.9%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted full-year revenue guidance missing analysts\u2019 expectations and a miss of analysts\u2019 earnings estimates.\n\nHillenbrand delivered the weakest full-year guidance update in the group. As expected, the stock is down 25.6% since the results and currently trades at $28.30.\n\nRead our full analysis of Hillenbrand\u2019s results here.\n\nL.B.
